Status: Requires refactoring - exceeds 500-line limit
Date: 2025-06-13
Reason: Philosophy #1 compliance - file must be under 500 lines

Recommended refactoring approach:
1. Extract AddTemplateForm component to separate file
2. Extract template management logic to custom hook
3. Split UI sections into smaller components
4. Maintain existing functionality while reducing file size
