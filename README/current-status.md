## 🔧 Recent Major Updates (October 2025)

### Intelligent Chat System with Contextual Awareness
**Completed**: October 22, 2025

**Enhancement**: Implemented a sophisticated multi-stage chat processing pipeline with contextual awareness, intent classification, and comprehensive LLM debugging capabilities.

**What Changed**:
1. **Contextual Awareness Layer**: Analyzes user messages in full conversation context to understand actual intent
2. **Intent Classification**: Determines if tools are needed before loading them, saving ~750ms per message
3. **Unified Context Loading**: Combines working memory and relevant history into a single async operation
4. **LLM Debug Modal**: Real-time tracking and display of all LLM calls with token usage and timing
5. **V2-Only Architecture**: Removed V1 chat system, streamlined to V2 exclusively

**Chat Processing Pipeline**:
```
User Message
  ↓
[Stage 1] Contextual Awareness Analysis (gpt-4o-mini, ~2-3s)
  → Interprets message in conversation context
  → Resolves implicit references ("it", "that contact", etc.)
  → Determines actual user intent
  ↓
[Stage 2] Intent Classification (gpt-4o-mini, ~1-2s)
  → Decides if tools are needed
  → Identifies capability questions vs action requests
  → Skips tool loading if not needed (750ms saved)
  ↓
[Stage 3] Unified Context Loading (async, ~95ms)
  → Loads agent settings, conversation summary, recent messages in parallel
  → Injects context early in message array
  ↓
[Stage 4] Tool Loading (conditional, ~750ms)
  → Only loads if Stage 2 determines tools needed
  ↓
[Stage 5] Main LLM Call (agent's model, variable)
  → Processes with full context and guidance
  → May execute tools if needed
  ↓
[Stage 6] Response Synthesis
  → Ensures proper formatting
  → Handles tool results
```

**Implementation Details**:
- **Contextual Awareness**: `supabase/functions/chat/processor/utils/contextual-awareness.ts`
  - Fetches conversation summary and recent messages
  - Analyzes user intent with agent personality context
  - Resolves ambiguous references
  - Caches interpretations (5-min TTL, max 500 entries)
  - System prompt stored in database (`system_prompts` table)
  
- **Intent Classifier**: `supabase/functions/chat/processor/utils/intent-classifier.ts`
  - Distinguishes capability questions from action requests
  - Returns tool requirements with confidence scores
  - Caches classifications (5-min TTL, max 1000 entries)
  - System prompt stored in database
  
- **Unified Context Loader**: `supabase/functions/chat/core/context/unified_context_loader.ts`
  - Parallel loading of agent settings, summary, and history
  - Single formatted context message
  - Token usage tracking
  
- **LLM Debug Modal**: `src/components/modals/LLMDebugModal.tsx`
  - Displays all LLM calls with full request/response data
  - Shows input/output tokens separately
  - Includes timing and model information
  - Expandable stages with copy-to-clipboard

**Database Changes**:
- Added `llm_calls` field to `ProcessingMetrics` interface
- System prompts stored in `system_prompts` table for easy updates
- Migration: `supabase/migrations/20251020000001_add_contextual_awareness_prompt.sql`
- Migration: `supabase/migrations/20251020000002_update_intent_classifier_capability_questions.sql`

**Performance Improvements**:
- ✅ **750ms saved** per non-tool message by skipping tool loading
- ✅ **Parallel context loading** reduces latency
- ✅ **Caching** for interpretations and classifications
- ✅ **Database-stored prompts** eliminate hardcoded strings

**Token Usage Tracking**:
- ✅ Input tokens (prompt) tracked separately
- ✅ Output tokens (completion) tracked separately
- ✅ Total tokens calculated across all stages
- ✅ Per-stage breakdown in Debug Modal

**Impact**:
- ✅ Agents understand context and implicit references
- ✅ Fewer unnecessary tool calls
- ✅ Faster responses for informational queries
- ✅ Complete visibility into LLM processing
- ✅ Better cost tracking with token breakdown
- ✅ Database-managed system prompts for easy tuning

### Universal MCP System Implementation
**Completed**: October 4, 2025

**Enhancement**: Transformed the MCP system from Zapier-only to support ANY MCP-compliant server, enabling integration with Retell AI, Anthropic, OpenAI, and custom MCP implementations.

**What Changed**:
1. **Database Schema**: Added `server_capabilities`, `server_info`, `protocol_version`, and `last_successful_call` columns
2. **Server Detection**: Intelligent auto-detection of server types from initialization responses
3. **Health Monitoring**: Automatic tracking of connection health and successful tool calls
4. **UI Updates**: Changed "Zapier MCP" to "MCP" throughout the interface
5. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing Zapier connections continue to work seamlessly

**Implementation Details**:
- **Server Detection Module**: `supabase/functions/_shared/mcp-server-detection.ts` - Detects Zapier, Retell AI, Anthropic, OpenAI, custom, and generic MCP servers
- **Edge Functions Updated**: `create-mcp-connection` now auto-detects server type; `mcp-execute` tracks health
- **Health Monitoring Functions**: `check_mcp_server_health`, `record_mcp_tool_success`, `get_mcp_server_type_stats`
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20251002000001_universal_mcp_support.sql` - Safe, idempotent migration

**Supported MCP Servers**:
- ✅ **Zapier MCP** - 8,000+ app integrations (existing connections migrated automatically)

**Impact**:
- ✅ System now truly universal - connect to any MCP server
- ✅ Server type and capabilities auto-detected
- ✅ Health monitoring for all connections
- ✅ Zero breaking changes for existing users
- ✅ Scalable for future MCP server types

**Documentation**:
- **Investigation Report**: `docs/MCP_UNIVERSAL_SYSTEM_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md`

## 🔧 Recent Major Fixes (September 2025)

### Tool Settings & Discovery System Overhaul
**Completed**: September 30, 2025

**Problem**: Agent tools were appearing regardless of UI toggle settings. Users could disable tools in the UI, but agents would still have access to all tools.

**Root Cause**: The `get-agent-tools` edge function was not properly checking tool toggle settings, allowing agents access to tools regardless of UI toggle states.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Created `getToolSettings()` function** - Centralized function to fetch all tool toggle states from agent metadata
2. **Provider-to-Setting Mapping** - Systematic mapping of service providers to their required settings
3. **Provider-Level Filtering** - Skip entire providers if their required setting is disabled
4. **Default-to-Disabled Logic** - All tool settings default to `false` for security

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/functions/get-agent-tools/database-service.ts` - Added `getToolSettings()` function
- `supabase/functions/get-agent-tools/index.ts` - Added filtering logic and provider mapping
- `src/components/modals/agent-settings/BehaviorTab.tsx` - Clarified default behavior

**Impact**:
- ✅ All tool toggles now work correctly
- ✅ Tools default to disabled (secure by default)
- ✅ Clear UI feedback matches actual tool availability
- ✅ Simplified codebase with consistent logic
- ✅ Better security through explicit opt-in

**Tool Categories Affected**:
- Voice Synthesis (elevenlabs) → `voice_enabled`
- Web Search (serper_api) → `web_search_enabled`
- Document Creation → `document_creation_enabled`
- OCR Processing → `ocr_processing_enabled`
