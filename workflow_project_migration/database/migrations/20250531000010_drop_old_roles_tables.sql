DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.team_roles;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.client_roles;

-- Add comments if desired, e.g.:
-- COMMENT ON TABLE public.team_roles IS 'DEPRECATED and DROPPED: Replaced by user_roles table.';
-- COMMENT ON TABLE public.client_roles IS 'DEPRECATED and DROPPED: Replaced by roles and user_roles tables.';
-- Since they are dropped, comments are not strictly necessary but can be good for documentation if the script is reviewed.
