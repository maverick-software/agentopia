### Monitoring & Logging
- **Critical Gap Identified**: Comprehensive logging infrastructure missing
- **Current State**: Minimal logging in `/logs/` directory
- **Immediate Priority**: Implement structured logging across all services

## Current Architecture Challenges

Based on May 2025 analysis, several areas require immediate attention:

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues
1. **Missing Logging Infrastructure**
   - `/logs/` directory nearly empty
   - No structured logging across services
   - Severely hampers debugging and monitoring

2. **Code Quality Violations**
   - `supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`: 612 lines (exceeds 500-line limit)
   - `src/pages/DatastoresPage.tsx`: 664 lines (exceeds 500-line limit)

3. **Architecture Transition**
   - Tool infrastructure refactor in progress
   - Migration from per-agent to shared droplet model
   - Incomplete DTMA system transformation

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority
- **Token Estimation**: Simple character count instead of proper tokenizer
- **Test Coverage**: Gaps in comprehensive testing
- **API Documentation**: Limited formal API specifications

## Security & Performance

### Security Measures
- **Supabase Authentication**
  - Built-in user management with secure session handling
  - OAuth integration capabilities
