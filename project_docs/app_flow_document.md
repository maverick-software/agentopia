# Agentopia App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user arrives at Agentopia, they first encounter a friendly landing page that introduces the platform and explains its role in creating and managing AI agents for Discord. Users are welcomed by a clean, dark-themed interface that uses the Poppins font for a modern look. The app provides a straightforward sign-up process managed by Supabase where users can create an account using their email address or social login credentials. There is also an option for password recovery through a simple, step-by-step process that sends password reset instructions to the user’s email. After signing up, users sign in with secure credentials, and they always have the option to sign out when their session ends.

# Agentopia Application Flow Document
**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** May 11, 2025  
**Based on:** Current codebase analysis and actual user flows  

This document describes the actual user journeys and application flows in Agentopia as implemented in May 2025, based on comprehensive codebase analysis of the React/TypeScript frontend and Supabase backend.

## Application Entry Points and Authentication

### Initial Access and Sign-In Flow
Users access Agentopia through the main web application (`src/main.tsx` → `src/App.tsx` → `src/routing/AppRouter.tsx`). The authentication system is powered by Supabase Auth with the following flows:

1. **Landing/Login Page**: Users are presented with a clean authentication interface
2. **Registration Flow**: New users can create accounts with email/password
3. **OAuth Integration**: Support for Google, Discord, and GitHub sign-in (planned)
4. **Password Recovery**: Email-based password reset functionality
5. **MFA Support**: Multi-factor authentication via authenticator apps (planned)

After successful authentication, users are redirected to the main dashboard based on their role and permissions managed through Supabase RLS (Row Level Security).
