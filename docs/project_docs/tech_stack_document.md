  - Primary hosting for backend services
  - Shared droplet model for tool environments
  - PM2 process management for high availability

- **Supabase Cloud**
  - Managed PostgreSQL hosting
  - Global edge network for Edge Functions
  - Built-in monitoring and analytics

### Development & Deployment Pipeline
- **Git Version Control**
  - Comprehensive branching strategy
  - Code review processes
  - Automated testing integration

- **Docker Containerization**
  - Consistent deployment environments
  - Service isolation and scalability
  - Container orchestration via Dockerode

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Critical Gap Identified**: Comprehensive logging infrastructure missing
- **Current State**: Minimal logging in `/logs/` directory
- **Immediate Priority**: Implement structured logging across all services

## Current Architecture Challenges

Based on May 2025 analysis, several areas require immediate attention:

### 🔴 Critical Issues
1. **Missing Logging Infrastructure**
   - `/logs/` directory nearly empty
   - No structured logging across services
   - Severely hampers debugging and monitoring

2. **Code Quality Violations**
   - `supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`: 612 lines (exceeds 500-line limit)
   - `src/pages/DatastoresPage.tsx`: 664 lines (exceeds 500-line limit)

3. **Architecture Transition**
   - Tool infrastructure refactor in progress
   - Migration from per-agent to shared droplet model
   - Incomplete DTMA system transformation

### 🟡 Medium Priority
- **Token Estimation**: Simple character count instead of proper tokenizer
- **Test Coverage**: Gaps in comprehensive testing
- **API Documentation**: Limited formal API specifications

## Security & Performance

### Security Measures
- **Supabase Authentication**
  - Built-in user management with secure session handling
  - OAuth integration capabilities
  - Row Level Security policies at database level

- **API Key Management**
  - Supabase Vault for encrypted storage
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Principle of least privilege access

### Performance Optimizations
- **Frontend Performance**
  - Vite's optimized bundling and code splitting
  - React 18's concurrent features
  - Tailwind CSS purging for minimal bundle size

- **Backend Performance**
  - Supabase edge functions for low latency
  - PostgreSQL query optimization
  - Vector search optimization via Pinecone
