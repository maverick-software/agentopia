# Hide "New Chat" Button from Navigation - December 31, 2025

## Summary
Removed the "New Chat" button from both desktop sidebar and mobile drawer navigation to prevent users from accessing the system agent (Gofr) directly. Users should now create and interact with their own agents instead.

## Changes Made

### 1. Desktop Sidebar (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`)
- **Removed**: "New Chat" navigation item that linked to `/chat`
- **Removed**: Unused `SquarePen` icon import
- **Location**: Lines 64-89 (navItems array)
- **Impact**: Users can no longer click "New Chat" in the desktop sidebar

### 2. Mobile Drawer (`src/components/mobile/MobileDrawer.tsx`)
- **Removed**: "New Chat" navigation item from mobile menu
- **Location**: Lines 127-157 (mainNavItems array)
- **Impact**: Users can no longer click "New Chat" in the mobile drawer

## Technical Details

### What was `/chat`?
The `/chat` route was designed to provide a ChatGPT-like experience where users could chat without selecting a specific agent. It automatically:
1. Found the Gofr system agent (identified by `metadata.is_system_agent = true`)
2. Created or retrieved a conversation with Gofr
3. Redirected to the agent chat page

### System Agent
- **Name**: Gofr
- **Identification**: `metadata.is_system_agent = true`
- **Purpose**: Universal assistant accessible to all users
- **Status**: Still exists in the database but no longer accessible via main navigation

## User Experience Impact

### Before
- Users saw "New Chat" at the top of the navigation
- Clicking it started a conversation with the system agent (Gofr)
- Users could chat without creating their own agents

### After
- "New Chat" button is removed from navigation
- Users must navigate to "Agents" page
- Users must create their own agents or select existing ones
- Encourages user-created agent usage

## Related Files

### Still Active (Not Modified)
- `src/pages/ChatPage.tsx` - The `/chat` route handler (still functional if accessed directly)
- `src/pages/AgentChatPage.tsx` - Main chat interface for all agents
- `src/routing/routeConfig.tsx` - Route definition (still includes `/chat` route)

### Database
- `agents` table - Gofr agent still exists with `metadata.is_system_agent = true`
- No database changes required

## Code Comments
Both modified files include explanatory comments:
```typescript
// NOTE: "New Chat" removed - users should create and chat with their own agents
// The system agent (Gofr) is not exposed via the main navigation
```

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Removed "New Chat" from desktop sidebar
- [x] Removed "New Chat" from mobile drawer
- [x] Removed unused imports
- [x] No linter errors introduced
- [ ] Verify UI renders correctly without the button (desktop)
- [ ] Verify UI renders correctly without the button (mobile)
- [ ] Verify users can still access agents via "Agents" page
- [ ] Verify direct navigation to `/chat` still works (if needed for admin/future use)

## Rollback Instructions
If this change needs to be reverted:

1. **Restore Sidebar.tsx navItems array** (line 64):
```typescript
const navItems: NavItem[] = [
  { 
    to: '/chat', 
    icon: SquarePen, 
    label: 'New chat',
    isCustom: false
  },
  // ... rest of items
];
```

2. **Restore SquarePen import** (line 12):
```typescript
MessageCircle, SquarePen, Brain
```

3. **Restore MobileDrawer.tsx mainNavItems** (line 128):
```typescript
const mainNavItems = [
  {
    id: 'new-chat',
    label: 'New Chat',
    icon: Plus,
    path: '/chat',
    divider: false
  },
  // ... rest of items
];
```

## Philosophy Compliance
- ✅ **Philosophy #1**: Files remain under 500 lines
- ✅ **Philosophy #2**: Clear reasoning documented
- ✅ **Rule #3**: Do no harm - code commented, not deleted (easy rollback)

## Additional Notes
- The `/chat` route and ChatPage component remain functional for potential future use or admin access
- The Gofr system agent remains in the database and can still be accessed programmatically
- This change only affects UI navigation, not underlying functionality
- Consider adding admin-only access to system agent in future if needed
