## Project Structure & Key Components

*   **Goal:** Agentopia - A platform for creating, managing, and collaborating with AI agents. Focus on Workspace-based collaboration, with optional Discord integration, RAG (via Pinecone/datastores), and MCP capabilities.
*   **Tech Stack:** React/Vite/TS (Frontend), Supabase (DB, Auth, Realtime, Edge Functions, Vault), Node.js/TS (Backend Workers on DigitalOcean), Discord.js, PM2, Pinecone.
*   **Core Directories:**
    *   `src/`: Frontend (React/Vite/TS) - Components, Contexts, Hooks, Lib, Pages, Routing, Types.
    *   `supabase/functions/`: Supabase Edge Functions (API Layer - `chat`, `discord-interaction-handler`, `manage-discord-worker`, etc.).
    *   `supabase/migrations/`: Database schema migrations.
    *   `services/`: Backend workers (`discord-worker`, `worker-manager`) hosted on DigitalOcean, managed by PM2.
    *   `docs/`: Project documentation (context, plans, bugs, checklists, index).
    *   `.cursor/rules/`: AI operational rules and protocols.
    *   `logs/`: Intended for application logs (currently contains only a README).
    *   `public/`: Static assets.
*   **Key Documentation:** `README.md` (detailed project overview), `docs/index.md` (high-level file index), various files in `docs/context/` and `.cursor/rules/`.

## Database Schema Overview

*   PostgreSQL managed by Supabase.
*   Key tables include: `users`, `user_profiles`, `teams`, `team_members`, `agents`, `datastores`, `agent_datastores`, `mcp_servers`, `mcp_configurations`, `workspaces`, `workspace_members`, `chat_channels`, `chat_messages`.
*   Extensive use of Row Level Security (RLS) is evident from migration files.
*   Migrations are located in `supabase/migrations/` and show ongoing development, particularly around workspace and chat functionalities.

## Application Entry Points & API Endpoints

*   **Web UI (Frontend):** `src/main.tsx` (Vite entry point).
*   **Supabase Edge Functions (API):**
    *   `/chat` (POST): Core AI agent response generation.
    *   `/discord-interaction-handler` (POST): Handles Discord webhook interactions.
    *   `/manage-discord-worker` (POST): For frontend to manage Discord worker lifecycle.
    *   `/register-agent-commands` (POST): Discord command registration.
    *   `/update-agent-discord-token` (POST): Updates agent's Discord bot token.
    *   `/discord-get-bot-guilds` (POST): Fetches guilds a bot is in.
*   **Backend Services:**
    *   `worker-manager`: Listens for HTTP POST requests to manage `discord-worker` processes.
    *   `discord-worker`: Connects to Discord Gateway; entry point for Discord events for a specific agent.

## Key Findings, Discrepancies & Potential Issues

1.  **CRITICAL: Missing Logs (Rule #2 Violation):**
    *   The `docs/console/logs/` directory is empty.
    *   The `logs/` directory only contains a `README.md` file, not actual application logs.
    *   This significantly hinders debugging and operational monitoring.
2.  **Large Files (Philosophy #1 Violation):**
    *   `src/pages/AgentEditPage.tsx` (approx. 1326 lines)
    *   `src/pages/DatastoresPage.tsx` (approx. 664 lines)
    *   These files exceed the 500-line limit and require refactoring plans.
    *   The currently open file, `src/hooks/useAgentDiscordConnection_refactored.ts` (283 lines), is well within limits.
3.  **Team Membership Workspace Access:**
    *   The `README.md` notes: "The `fetchWorkspaces` hook doesn't currently grant workspace access based on Team membership; this might need enhancement." This needs investigation.
4.  **Potential Frontend Build Error (Unverified):**
    *   Previous context mentioned a potential duplicate `isAdmin` variable in `AuthContext.tsx`. This status remains unverified and should be checked if frontend build or runtime issues arise.
5.  **Resolved Bug:**
    *   The `discord-interaction-handler` bug (related to "Interaction secret missing") documented in `docs/bugs/discord-interaction-handler.md` is confirmed as **RESOLVED**.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1.  **Immediate Priority: Implement Logging:** Establish comprehensive logging across all services (Frontend, Supabase Functions, Backend Services) and ensure logs are stored in the designated `logs/` and/or `docs/console/logs/` directories. This is crucial for adherence to Rule #2.
2.  **Refactor Large Files:**
    *   Develop and execute a refactoring plan for `src/pages/AgentEditPage.tsx`.
    *   Develop and execute a refactoring plan for `src/pages/DatastoresPage.tsx`.
3.  **Investigate Workspace Access:** Review the `fetchWorkspaces` hook and related logic to ensure workspace access correctly incorporates team memberships.
4.  **Verify `AuthContext.tsx`:** If frontend issues are present, investigate the potential `isAdmin` variable conflict in `AuthContext.tsx`.
