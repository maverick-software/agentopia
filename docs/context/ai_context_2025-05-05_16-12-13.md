# AI Context Document - Mon 05/05/2025 16:12:13.11

This document summarizes the system state and context following the execution of the `new_chat_protocol` on Mon 05/05/2025. It incorporates findings from the previous context document (`ai_context_2025-04-30.md`) and verifies current status.

## Investigation Date & Time
Mon 05/05/2025 16:12:13.11

## Project Structure & Key Components

*   **Goal:** Agentopia - A platform for creating, managing, and collaborating with AI agents. Focus on Workspace-based collaboration, with optional Discord integration, RAG (via Pinecone/datastores), and MCP capabilities.
*   **Tech Stack:** React/Vite/TS (Frontend), Supabase (DB, Auth, Realtime, Edge Functions, Vault), Node.js/TS (Backend Workers on DigitalOcean `165.22.172.98`), Discord.js, PM2, Pinecone.
*   **Core Directories:** `src/` (Frontend), `supabase/functions/` (API Layer), `supabase/migrations/` (DB), `services/` (Backend Workers: `discord-worker`, `worker-manager`), `docs/` (Documentation), `.cursor/rules/` (AI Rules).
*   **Documentation:** `README.md` (Detailed overview), `docs/` (plans, context, bugs, index), `docs/index.md` (High-level index), `.cursor/rules/` (Specific protocols and guidelines like UI/UX).
*   **Logging:** Defined locations `logs/` and `docs/console/logs/` exist but are **empty**.

## Core Functionality Breakdown (Based on previous context & README)

1.  **Frontend (`src/`):** User/Admin UI built with React/Vite/TS/Shadcn UI/Tailwind. Manages Workspaces, Agents, Datastores, Teams, MCP, and optional Discord connections.
2.  **Workspace Collaboration:** Core feature. Users/Agents/Teams interact within Channels in Workspaces. Real-time updates via Supabase. Configurable context windows per workspace.
3.  **Supabase Functions (`supabase/functions/`):**
    *   `chat`: Central AI logic. Handles message history, RAG, MCP, context limits, calls OpenAI, saves/streams messages.
    *   `discord-interaction-handler`: Handles Discord slash commands/interactions (webhook). Verifies signatures, decrypts secrets, can trigger `worker-manager`.
    *   `manage-discord-worker`: Frontend endpoint to start/stop Discord workers via `worker-manager`.
    *   `register-agent-commands`: Sets up Discord commands.
4.  **Backend Services (`services/` on DO `165.22.172.98:8000`):**
    *   `worker-manager`: Manages `discord-worker` lifecycle using PM2 API. Triggered by Supabase functions.
    *   `discord-worker`: Connects a specific agent to Discord Gateway. Listens for mentions, calls `/chat` function, relays responses.

## Database Overview (`supabase/migrations/`)

*   **Schema:** PostgreSQL via Supabase. Key tables: `users`, `user_profiles`, `teams`, `team_members`, `agents`, `datastores`, `agent_datastores`, `mcp_servers`, `mcp_configurations`, `workspaces`, `workspace_members`, `chat_channels`, `chat_messages`.
*   **RLS:** Extensively used for security. Policies defined in migrations.
*   **Recent Activity:** Focus on Workspace/Chat features (`workspaces`, `workspace_members`, `chat_channels`, `chat_messages` tables and RLS). Older `chat_sessions` replaced by `chat_rooms` (though `README.md` still refers to `chat_rooms`, the migrations show `chat_channels` etc - need to clarify table names).

## Key Findings & Potential Issues

1.  **CRITICAL: Missing Logs (Rule #2 Violation):** Log directories (`docs/console/logs/`, `logs/`) are empty. This severely hinders debugging and monitoring. **Immediate priority to implement logging.**
2.  **Large Files (Philosophy #1 Violation):**
    *   `src/pages/AgentEditPage.tsx` (~1326 lines)
    *   `src/pages/DatastoresPage.tsx` (~664 lines)
    *   These exceed the 500-line limit and require refactoring plans per AI philosophy.
3.  **Resolved Bug:** The `discord-interaction-handler` bug documented in `docs/bugs/` is confirmed as **RESOLVED**.
4.  **Database Schema Consistency:** Potential discrepancy in table naming between `README.md` (`chat_rooms`) and recent migrations (`chat_channels`). Needs clarification. The complexity of recent Workspace/Chat migrations warrants thorough testing.
5.  **Frontend Build Error:** Previous context mentioned a potential duplicate `isAdmin` variable in `AuthContext.tsx`. Status unverified, needs checking if frontend issues arise.
6.  **Team Membership Access:** `README.md` notes a potential limitation in the `fetchWorkspaces` hook regarding team-based access.

## Application Entry Points

*   **Web UI:** `src/main.tsx` (served via Vite).
*   **Supabase Functions:**
    *   `/chat` (POST, likely from Frontend and `discord-worker`)
    *   `/discord-interaction-handler` (POST from Discord webhook)
    *   `/manage-discord-worker` (POST from Frontend)
*   **Worker Manager Service:** `http://165.22.172.98:8000` (Listens for POST requests from Supabase functions).
