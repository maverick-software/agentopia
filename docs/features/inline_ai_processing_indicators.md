# Inline AI Processing Indicators

## Overview
The chat interface now includes subtle, inline AI processing indicators that show the agent's thinking process directly within the chat flow, rather than just in the header.

## Features

### 1. Subtle Process Indicators
- **Location**: Inline within the chat messages
- **Appearance**: Small, non-intrusive indicators above thinking graphics
- **States Tracked**:
  - 🧠 Thinking (analyzing user message)
  - ⚙️ Analyzing tools (checking available tools)
  - 🔧 Executing tool (using specific tools)
  - ⚡ Processing results (handling tool outputs)
  - 💬 Generating response (crafting final response)

### 2. Expandable Process Details
- **Clickable Dropdown**: Arrow indicator to expand/collapse
- **Detailed View Shows**:
  - Step-by-step process breakdown
  - Tool execution details (tool name, provider)
  - Timing information for each step
  - Success/failure indicators
  - Chain of thought progression

### 3. Smart Behavior
- **During Processing**: Shows current step with animation
- **After Completion**: Becomes expandable historical record
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Thinking message automatically removed after response
- **Preservation**: Process details preserved in expandable form

## Implementation

### Key Components

1. **InlineThinkingIndicator** (`src/components/InlineThinkingIndicator.tsx`)
   - Main component for displaying thinking process
   - Handles expansion/collapse of details
   - Shows current state and completed steps

2. **Message Type Extension** (`src/types/index.ts`)
   - Added `'thinking'` role to Message interface
   - Added `aiProcessDetails` for storing process information

3. **Chat Integration** (`src/pages/AgentChatPage.tsx`)
   - Tracks AI processing steps in real-time
   - Creates temporary thinking messages
   - Updates process details as AI progresses

### Process Flow

1. **User sends message**
2. **Thinking message added** to chat with inline indicator
3. **AI processing begins** with subtle animations
4. **Steps tracked** and displayed in real-time:
   - Thinking → Analyzing tools → Executing tool → Processing → Generating
5. **Completion** shows expandable summary
6. **Auto-cleanup** removes thinking message after response

### Example User Experience

```
User: "Send an email to John about the meeting"

[Thinking Indicator appears]
💭 Thinking... ⚙️ 

[Expandable when clicked]
✅ Analyzing your message (234ms)
✅ Checking available tools (156ms) 
🔧 Using send_email via Gmail (1.2s)
✅ Processing tool results (89ms)
💬 Generating response (456ms)

Agent: "I've sent the email to John about the meeting. The email was delivered successfully."
```

## Benefits
