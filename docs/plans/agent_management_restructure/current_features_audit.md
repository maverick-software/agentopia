# üîç **Current Agent Edit Page Features Audit**
## Complete Feature Catalog
*Timestamp: $(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss')*

## üéØ **Overview**

**CURRENT STATE**: The agent edit page contains extensive technical configuration options that feel more like managing a software system than working with a person-like AI agent.

**GOAL**: Transform these features into intuitive, conversational popup windows accessible from the agent chat page, making users feel like they're personalizing and working with actual people.
