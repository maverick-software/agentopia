# WBS Checklist: Advanced Reasoning Capability (via MCP Server)
**Date Created:** 05/06/2025
**Plan Name:** Advanced Reasoning Capability (via MCP Server)

## Phase 1: Research and Foundational Design

### 1.1 Research (Rule #6: Check Web) - *Primarily informs Reasoning MCP Server design*
- [x] 1.1.1 Research: Prompting techniques for Inductive Reasoning in LLMs
    - **Notes - Inductive Reasoning Prompts:**
        - **General Principle:** Guide the LLM to identify patterns in provided examples and then generalize a rule or hypothesis.
        - **Few-Shot Learning:** Provide several examples (instance, observation) and then ask the LLM to derive a general principle or predict the next instance.
        - **Explicit Instruction:** "Based on the following examples, what is the underlying pattern or rule?" or "Generate a hypothesis that explains these observations."
        - **Step-by-Step Analysis:** "Analyze each example: Example 1 -> Observation 1. Example 2 -> Observation 2. What general rule connects these observations to the examples?"
        - **Hypothesis Generation and Testing (Iterative):**
            - Prompt to generate an initial hypothesis based on a subset of data.
            - Prompt to test the hypothesis against new data.
            - Prompt to refine the hypothesis if it fails the test.
        - **Consider Analogical Reasoning:** "This new problem is similar to [solved problem X]. How did we solve X, and how can that apply here?" (Though this borders on case-based, it uses inductive leaps).
        - **Focus on Salient Features:** "What are the key distinguishing features in these examples that might lead to the observed outcomes?"
        - **Output Format:** Ask for the generalized rule to be stated clearly.
        - **Key Takeaway:** Emphasis on providing clear examples and guiding the LLM to generalize from them. The process can be iterative.
- [x] 1.1.2 Research: Prompting techniques for Deductive Reasoning in LLMs
    - **Notes - Deductive Reasoning Prompts:**
        - **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is Fundamental:** Explicitly ask to "think step-by-step" or "show reasoning." This helps in breaking down problems, applying rules sequentially. Enhances accuracy and transparency.
            - *Example:* "If A=B and B=C, explain step-by-step if A=C and why."
        - **Few-Shot Examples with CoT:** Provide examples demonstrating the step-by-step deductive process.
        - **Clarity and Specificity:**
            - Clearly define the problem and desired output format.
            - Use unambiguous language.
            - Break down complex tasks into smaller prompts if needed.
        - **Structured Prompting:**
            - *QA Format:* Question with explicit request for reasoning steps before the answer.
            - *Instructional Steps:* Provide a numbered list of logical steps for the model to follow.
            - *Templates:* Use consistent templates for recurring tasks (Background, Objective, Reasoning, Conclusion).
        - **Advanced CoT Variations (applicable):**
            - *Self-Consistency:* Generate multiple deductive paths, choose the most consistent conclusion.
            - *Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT):* Explore multiple deductive branches, evaluate validity, backtrack if needed. Useful when the path isn't obvious.
            - *Decomposed Prompting:* Break complex query into sequential sub-questions.
        - **Providing Rules/Axioms:** Explicitly state rules, axioms, or premises.
            - *Example:* "Given: 'All X are Y' and 'Z is X'. Deduce: Relationship between Z and Y. Show work."
        - **Socratic Method:** Guide deduction through dialogue (definition, elenchus, dialectic).
        - **DID (Deductive and InDuctive) Framework:** Dynamically integrates inductive and deductive reasoning. The deductive part involves applying derived rules.
        - **Modern Prompt Structure (Goal, Return Format, Warnings, Context):** Clearly state goal, specify output format, add coherence checks/warnings, provide context.
        - **Key Takeaway:** Start with clear CoT, possibly with few-shot examples. For complex cases, consider self-consistency or simplified ToT. Explicitly stating rules/premises is crucial.
- [x] 1.1.3 Research: Prompting techniques for Abductive Reasoning in LLMs
    - **Notes - Abductive Reasoning Prompts (Inference to the Best Explanation):**
        - **1. Present Observations Clearly:** Input all relevant facts, symptoms, or data that need explaining.
            - *Example:* "Observations: The street is wet. It did not rain today. The sprinklers were not on. My car, parked on the street, is also wet."
        - **2. Multiple Hypothesis Generation:** Explicitly ask for several plausible explanations.
            - *Prompt:* "Based on these observations, list all plausible hypotheses that could explain them."
        - **3. Chain-of-Thought for Each Hypothesis:** For each hypothesis, ask how it explains the observations.
            - *Prompt:* "For each hypothesis, explain the step-by-step reasoning that connects it to ALL the observed facts."
        - **4. Evaluate and Rank Hypotheses:** Instruct the LLM to evaluate hypotheses based on criteria:
            - *Explanatory Power:* How well does it cover all observations?
            - *Simplicity (Occam's Razor):* Is it the least complex explanation?
            - *Plausibility/Likelihood:* Consistency with general knowledge or provided context.
            - *Internal Consistency:* Does it contradict itself or other knowns?
            - *Prompt:* "Evaluate each hypothesis on a scale of 1-5 for explanatory power, simplicity, and plausibility. Justify scores. Which is the most likely overall?"
        - **5. Reflective/Self-Critical Loops:** Prompt for review of hypotheses and evaluations.
            - *Prompt:* "Are there any flaws or missing pieces in your top hypothesis? Can any other hypothesis better explain a specific observation?"
        - **6. Iterative Refinement:** Allow for new evidence and re-evaluation.
            - *Prompt:* "New observation: A fire hydrant down the street is open. How does this affect your hypotheses? Re-evaluate."
        - **7. Consider Alternatives (Counterfactuals/Socratic):**
            - *Prompt:* "If your top hypothesis were false, what would be the next most likely explanation? What single piece of evidence would most strongly confirm/deny your current best explanation?"
        - **8. External Tool Use/Verification (Advanced):** LLM could suggest checks if integrated with tools.
        - **Key Takeaway (for MCP Server):** Abductive reasoning is a multi-step process for the server: receive observations -> generate multiple hypotheses (LLM call) -> evaluate/rank hypotheses (LLM call(s)) -> select best explanation -> return to Agentopia. It's inherently about exploring and weighing possibilities.
- [x] 1.1.4 Research: Advanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) variations (e.g., Self-Ask, Tree-of-Thoughts, Plan-and-Execute frameworks) - *Relevant for all reasoning types within the MCP Server*
    - **Notes - Advanced CoT Variations:**
        - **Standard CoT:** Baseline "think step-by-step."
        - **Self-Consistency (with CoT):** Generate multiple CoTs, take majority vote on the answer. Improves reliability.
            - *Use Case:* Critical steps needing higher accuracy.
        - **Tree of Thoughts (ToT):** Explores multiple reasoning paths in a tree. Generates multiple thoughts per step, evaluates them, and decides which path to pursue/backtrack. Mimics human-like exploration.
            - *Components:* Thought Decomposition, Thought Generation (sampling/proposing), State Evaluation (LLM self-evaluates promise), Search Algorithm (BFS/DFS).
            - *Use Case:* Complex problems needing exploration, strategic planning, lookahead (e.g., Game of 24, creative writing puzzles).
            - *Limitation:* Resource-intensive.
        - **Graph of Thoughts (GoT):** Extends ToT to a graph structure, allowing more complex thought interconnections (merging, refining, cycles).
        - **Algorithm of Thoughts (AoT):** Aims for structured, efficient algorithmic thinking emulation.
        - **Self-Ask:** LLM asks itself follow-up questions to decompose a problem, then uses answers to solve the main question.
        - **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting):** LLM generates interleaved reasoning traces (thoughts) and actions. Actions can use external tools (via `mcp/tools` in our case). (Thought -> Action -> Observation loop).
            - *Use Case:* Tasks needing external information or tool interaction to ground reasoning.
        - **Plan-and-Execute (or Plan-and-Solve):** Two-stage: 1. LLM generates a high-level plan (sequence of steps). 2. LLM (or orchestrator) executes each step, potentially using CoT/ReAct for individual steps.
            - *Use Case:* Overall architecture for the Reasoning MCP Server's internal orchestrator.
        - **Least-to-Most Prompting:** Decompose complex problem into simpler subproblems, solve sequentially, feeding previous solutions into next prompts.
        - **kNoT (Knowledgeable Network of Thoughts):** Uses an "LLM Workflow Template" (LWT) for executable plans as arbitrary networks of LLM operations.
        - **Key Takeaway (for MCP Server):** The Reasoning MCP Server could use a Plan-and-Execute overall strategy. Individual plan steps could leverage Standard CoT, Self-Consistency, Self-Ask/ReAct (for tool use via Agentopia), or even ToT for highly explorative steps. The choice can be dynamic or based on task complexity.
- [x] 1.1.5 Research: LLM Self-Evaluation & Confidence Scoring methodologies - *To be implemented within the Reasoning MCP Server*
    - **Notes - LLM Self-Evaluation & Confidence Scoring:**
        - **Goal:** Assess reliability of LLM's own reasoning/answers.
        - **Why Needed:** Standard likelihood scores (perplexity, sequence probability) often don't correlate well with quality/correctness.
        - **Confidence Score Elicitation Methods:**
            - **1. Verbalized Confidence:** Prompt LLM to state confidence (numeric scale 0-100, binary 0/1, linguistic). Simple but may need calibration.
            - **2. P(True) / Token Probability:** Prompt for binary confidence (0/1), use the actual probability assigned to the '1' token. Requires access to token probabilities. Performed well in CISC paper.
            - **3. Sequence Probability:** Use probability of the whole reasoning path + answer. Often less effective.
            - **4. Consistency-Based:** Derive confidence from agreement across multiple generated samples (e.g., SelfCheckGPT for factuality, majority vote proportion). More compute-intensive.
        - **Self-Evaluation Techniques (Broader than just scoring):**
            - **LLM-as-a-Judge (Internal):** Use an LLM (same or different) to evaluate generated reasoning/answer against criteria (G-Eval for subjective, DAG for structured checks, QAG for factuality).
            - **Self-Critique / Self-Refine:** Prompt LLM to critique its output and then improve it.
            - **SaySelf Framework:** Fine-tuning to generate confidence scores *and* self-reflective rationales explaining uncertainty.
        - **Evaluating the Confidence Scores Themselves:**
            - **Calibration:** Do scores match actual correctness probability (e.g., ECE)?
            - **Discrimination:** Can scores separate correct/incorrect answers (e.g., AUC)?
            - **Within-Question Discrimination (WQD):** Can scores distinguish correct/incorrect answers *for the same question*? (Important for weighting different paths).
        - **Key Takeaway (for MCP Server):** The Reasoning MCP server needs to output a confidence score. P(True) (if logits available) or Verbalized Confidence are primary candidates. Consistency checks (SelfCheckGPT) or internal LLM-as-a-Judge steps could enhance robustness before assigning the final score. Score should be returned to Agentopia.
- [x] 1.1.6 Research: Best practices for integrating complex reasoning flows with existing Tool Use functionalities - *Relevant for how the Reasoning MCP Server might request Agentopia to use tools via `mcp/tools` (see `mcp_developer_guide.mdc`)*
    - **Notes - Integrating Reasoning & Tool Use:**
        - **Core Idea:** Allow the reasoning process (within the MCP server) to leverage external tools provided by the host (Agentopia).
        - **Mechanism (ReAct/Agentic Loop):**
            - **Think:** Reasoning Server determines a need for external info/action.
            - **Act:** Reasoning Server sends `mcp/tools/call` request to Agentopia, specifying tool name & args.
            - **Observe:** Agentopia executes the tool and sends the result (or error) back to the Reasoning Server (e.g., via `mcp/tools/result` or response).
            - **Think:** Reasoning Server incorporates the observation into its ongoing reasoning plan.
        - **Best Practices for Agentopia's Role (Host):**
            - **Clear Tool Definitions:** Agentopia must provide clear, specific, natural language descriptions of its tools (via MCP, perhaps `mcp/tools/list`) so the Reasoning Server can select appropriately.
            - **Reliable Execution:** Agentopia needs to execute requested tools reliably.
            - **Structured Results:** Send results back to the Reasoning Server in a predictable, structured format.
            - **Error Reporting:** Clearly report tool execution errors back to the Reasoning Server.
        - **Best Practices for Reasoning MCP Server's Role (Agent):**
            - **Reason Before Acting:** Internally justify *why* a tool is needed before requesting it.
            - **Handle Observations:** Integrate tool results/errors gracefully into the reasoning flow.
            - **Error Recovery:** Plan for failed tool calls (retry, ask user via Agentopia?, alternative path).
            - **Simplicity:** Don't request tools unnecessarily.
        - **Key Takeaway (for Interaction):** The core interaction is the Reasoning Server requesting tool execution from Agentopia via standard or custom MCP methods (`mcp/tools/call`, `mcp/tools/result`). Success depends heavily on clear tool descriptions from Agentopia and robust handling of the request/response cycle by both ends.
- [x] 1.1.7 Research: MCP (Model Context Protocol) specification for custom capabilities and methods, focusing on how a server can advertise and execute complex, multi-step tasks like reasoning. (Primary Reference: `mcp_developer_guide.mdc`)
    - **Notes - MCP Specs for Custom Capabilities/Methods (from `mcp_developer_guide.mdc`):**
        - **Capability Advertisement:** Servers declare their capabilities (e.g., supported reasoning types, specific methods) in the `capabilities` object during the `initialize` handshake.
        - **Custom Methods:** Define custom, namespaced JSON-RPC methods (e.g., `reasoning/executeTask`) for the host (Agentopia) to call. Specify parameters and expected response structure.
        - **Executing Complex Tasks:** Complex, multi-step tasks are handled internally by the server logic triggered by a custom method call. The server manages its internal state and reasoning flow (e.g., using Plan-and-Execute, CoT variations).
        - **Context Provision:** Agentopia provides necessary input/context to the server using standard methods like `resources/provide`.
        - **Server-Initiated Actions:** If the server needs Agentopia to perform actions during its internal reasoning (e.g., fetch data via a tool), it uses standard methods like `tools/call`.
        - **Key Takeaway:** MCP provides the framework (initialization, JSON-RPC, standard methods) to integrate a custom reasoning server. The server advertises its specific reasoning functions as capabilities/custom methods, and handles the complex logic internally, potentially calling back to the host for tools/data as needed.

### 1.2 Design - Reasoning MCP Server: Capabilities & Interface
- [ ] 1.2.1 Define: How the Reasoning MCP Server advertises its capabilities (e.g., supported reasoning types: "inductive", "deductive", "abductive", "planAndExecuteCoT"; supported CoT variations; max complexity levels) in the MCP `initialize` response. (Refer to `mcp_developer_guide.mdc` on capabilities)
- [ ] 1.2.2 Design: Custom MCP method(s) for Agentopia to request reasoning tasks (e.g., `reasoning/executeTask` or `reasoning/generatePlanAndPrompt`). Define request parameters (e.g., `reasoningType`, `goalQuery`, `contextData`, `outputRequirements`) and response structure (e.g., `reasonedAnswer`, `confidenceScore`, `reasoningTrace`, `plan`, `promptsToExecute`). (Refer to `mcp_developer_guide.mdc` on JSON-RPC methods)
- [ ] 1.2.3 Evaluate: If standard MCP methods like `mcp/prompts` (server provides prompts for Agentopia to run) or `mcp/tools` (server requests Agentopia to run tools) can be leveraged or are sufficient for certain reasoning flows. (Consult `mcp_developer_guide.mdc`)
- [ ] 1.2.4 Define: LLM-friendly definitions, characteristics, and example prompts for Inductive, Deductive, and Abductive reasoning that the *Reasoning MCP Server* will use internally.
- [ ] 1.2.5 Design: Strategy for how these internal definitions (from 1.2.4) are used by the Reasoning MCP Server's internal orchestrator.

### 1.3 Design - Agentopia Integration with Reasoning MCP Server
- [ ] 1.3.1 Design: Logic within Agentopia (e.g., `chat` function or a new orchestrator) to determine *when* to invoke the Reasoning MCP Server (e.g., based on query complexity, user intent, or explicit agent configuration).
- [ ] 1.3.2 Design: Logic for Agentopia to select the appropriate reasoning type/goal to request from the Reasoning MCP Server based on its advertised capabilities and the nature of the user's query.
- [ ] 1.3.3 Design: How Agentopia handles responses from the Reasoning MCP Server:
    - If the server returns a final answer: integrate it.
    - If the server returns a plan or prompts (via `mcp/prompts` or custom method): Agentopia executes these with its own LLM.
    - If the server requests tool execution (via `mcp/tools`): Agentopia executes the tool and sends results back to the server.
- [ ] 1.3.4 Design: State management within Agentopia if the reasoning process involves multiple turns/interactions with the Reasoning MCP Server.
- [ ] 1.3.5 Design: How confidence scores and reasoning traces received from the MCP Server are processed and potentially displayed to the user.

### 1.4 Design - Data Model & UI/UX (Agentopia side)
- [ ] 1.4.1 Database Design: Confirm `agents` table has `advanced_reasoning_enabled` (boolean). This now signifies if the agent should attempt to use a configured Reasoning MCP Server.
- [ ] 1.4.2 Database Design: Leverage existing `mcp_servers` table to store configurations for the Reasoning MCP Server(s) (endpoint, API key, priority, specific capabilities if needed beyond auto-discovery). No new tables likely needed specifically for reasoning *traces* in Agentopia DB, as the server would manage its own.
- [ ] 1.4.3 Frontend Design: UI for the toggle switch on `AgentEditPage.tsx` for `advanced_reasoning_enabled`.
- [ ] 1.4.4 Frontend Design: Ensure the existing MCP server configuration UI in Agent Settings is suitable for adding and configuring Reasoning MCP Server(s). Users will select/configure the reasoning server here.
- [ ] 1.4.5 UX Design: Define how the agent's reasoning process (e.g., "Using Advanced Reasoning via [Server Name]: [Chosen Model]", key steps, confidence) is communicated to the user.

### 1.5 Design - Agentopia MCP Client Enhancements (If Needed)
- [ ] 1.5.1 Review: Current `MCPClient` and `MCPManager` in Agentopia for any modifications needed to support interaction with a dedicated Reasoning MCP Server (e.g., handling specific request/response structures for custom reasoning methods). (Consult `mcp_developer_guide.mdc` for client-side patterns)
- [ ] 1.5.2 Plan: Error handling strategy for interactions with the Reasoning MCP Server (e.g., server unavailable, reasoning task fails, low confidence). Define fallbacks.

## Phase 2: Reasoning MCP Server Implementation (Proof of Concept)

### 2.2 (Optional Initial) LLM Interface for Server
- [ ] 2.2.1 Implement: Secure mechanism for the Reasoning MCP Server to make calls to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic API). (This is internal to the server, but `mcp_developer_guide.mdc` might inform security best practices for external services)

    - If final answer: use it.
    - If prompts/plan: execute them.
    - If tool request: execute tool and send results back.
- [ ] 2.A.1.5 Implement: Handling of intermediate states if reasoning is multi-turn with the server.

### 2.A.2 Output Structuring (Agentopia side)
- [ ] 2.A.2.1 Ensure: Agentopia can correctly parse and utilize the detailed reasoning output (chosen model, plan, confidence) received from the MCP server.
- [ ] 2.A.2.2 Ensure: New output structure is compatible with existing message formats and frontend display logic.

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (Agentopia side)

### 3.1 Agent Edit Page (`AgentEditPage.tsx`)

- [ ] 3.1.4 Logic Implementation: Connect the toggle switch to update the agent's settings in the database.
- [ ] 3.1.5 State Management: Ensure frontend state correctly reflects the agent's reasoning capability setting.

### 3.2 (Optional Initial) Chat UI Display

- [ ] 4.2.5 Review & Address: Any biases or undesirable behaviors observed during testing.

## Phase 5: Logging (Adhering to Rule #2)

### 5.1 Agentopia-Side MCP Interaction Logging
- [ ] 5.1.1 Log: Request sent to Reasoning MCP Server (including target server, method, parameters).
- [ ] 5.1.2 Log: Response received from Reasoning MCP Server (summary, or full if not too verbose).
- [ ] 5.1.3 Log: Any errors during MCP communication with the reasoning server.

- [ ] 5.2.2 Log: Selected internal reasoning model (inductive, deductive etc.) and justification if dynamic.
- [ ] 5.2.3 Log: Generated reasoning plan/Chain-of-Thought.
- [ ] 5.2.4 Log: For each step in the server's internal plan: input, LLM calls made (prompt hash/summary, not full prompt if sensitive), LLM response summary, and step result.
- [ ] 5.2.5 Log: Any tool execution requests sent back to Agentopia.
- [ ] 5.2.6 Log: Final synthesized answer/response formulated by the server.
- [ ] 5.2.7 Log: Confidence assessment (score and justification).
- [ ] 5.2.8 Log: Any internal errors or fallback mechanisms triggered.
- [ ] 5.2.9 Ensure: All Reasoning MCP Server logs are written to an appropriate location with clear naming conventions.

### 5.3 Log Storage & Review
- [ ] 5.3.1 Establish: Process for reviewing logs from both Agentopia and the Reasoning MCP Server for debugging, performance analysis, and improvement.
