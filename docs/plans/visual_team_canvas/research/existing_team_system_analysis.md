# Existing Team System Analysis

**Research Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Purpose:** Analyze current team functionality before implementing visual canvas

## Current Database Schema

### Teams Table
```sql
teams: {
  id: uuid,
  name: text,                    -- Team name
  description: text,             -- Team purpose and description
  owner_user_id: uuid,           -- Team creator/owner
  created_at: timestamptz,       -- Creation timestamp
  updated_at: timestamptz        -- Last modification
}
```

### Team Members Table
```sql
team_members: {
  id: uuid,
  team_id: uuid,                 -- Reference to teams table
  agent_id: uuid,                -- Reference to agents table
  team_role: text,               -- Member role (member, project_manager, etc.)
  reports_to_user: boolean,      -- Whether member reports to user
  created_at: timestamptz
}
```

## Current UI Components

### TeamsPage.tsx (153 lines)
- **Location:** `src/pages/TeamsPage.tsx`
- **Current Display:** Grid layout with TeamCard components
- **Features:** 
  - Create New Team button
  - Modal-based team creation
  - Informational section explaining team organization
  - Loading and error states
  - Empty state with encouraging call-to-action

### Team Component Architecture
1. `TeamsPage.tsx` - Main teams listing
2. `CreateTeamModal.tsx` - Modal-based team creation
3. `TeamDetailsPage.tsx` - Team information display
4. `EditTeamPage.tsx` - Team editing
5. `TeamCard.tsx` - Individual team display cards
6. `TeamMemberList.tsx` - Team member management

## Current Team Management Features
- **Modal-Based Team Creation**: Streamlined workflow without page navigation
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages  
- **Modern UI**: Shadcn UI components with proper theming
- **Comprehensive Team Details**: Team information display with descriptions
- **Team Member Management**: Agent assignment and role management

## Key Insights
1. **Teams only contain agents** (not sub-teams or hierarchies)
2. **No visual relationships** between teams currently exist
3. **No positioning data** stored for teams
4. **Simple flat structure** - all teams at same level
5. **WCAG AA compliant theming** already implemented

## Gaps for Visual Canvas
1. **Missing:** Team positioning data (x, y coordinates)
2. **Missing:** Team-to-team relationship storage
3. **Missing:** Visual connection data between teams
4. **Missing:** Canvas viewport and zoom state persistence
5. **Missing:** Team hierarchy or parent-child relationships

## Integration Opportunities
- **Existing Theme System**: Light/dark mode support ready
- **Established Patterns**: Modal-based editing patterns can be reused
- **Component Architecture**: Modular approach for extending functionality
- **Database Foundation**: Teams table ready for extension with positioning fields
