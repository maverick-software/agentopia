## Notes Section

### General Notes:
- Follow Philosophy #1: Keep all files under 500 lines
- Review logs before making changes (Rule #2)
- Create backups before modifications (Rule #3)
- Never use `supabase db reset` (Forbidden #2)
- Focus on one problem at a time (Forbidden #2)

### Current Progress:
- Phase 1 (Setup): ✅ Complete
- Phase 2 (Research): 🔄 In Progress (1/5 complete)
- Remaining work: 6 phases to complete

### Key Decisions Made:
1. Using three-table approach for delegations
2. Three permission levels: view, manage, full_control
3. 30-day token expiration
4. Leveraging existing email infrastructure
5. Following GoDaddy's delegation pattern
