# Light Mode Implementation - Work Breakdown Structure Checklist

## 1. Research Phase ✅

### 1.1 Analyze existing theme-related code and architecture ✅
**REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING: TBD**  
**Plan Review & Alignment: Completed analysis of existing codebase, found forced dark mode in App.tsx and partial CSS variables**  
**Future Intent: Use existing infrastructure to build upon rather than replacing**  
**Cautionary Notes: Must ensure no conflicts with existing forced dark mode**  
**Backups: N/A - read-only analysis**  

### 1.2 Research modern theme switching best practices ✅
**REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING: TBD**  
**Plan Review & Alignment: Completed web research on React + Tailwind theme switching patterns**  
**Future Intent: Follow modern best practices for React Context + localStorage + CSS custom properties**  
**Cautionary Notes: Avoid complex state management, keep it simple and performant**  
**Backups: N/A - research only**  

### 1.3 Review database schema for theme preference storage ✅
**REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING: /docs/plans/light_mode_implementation/research/1.3_database_schema_analysis.md**  
**Plan Review & Alignment: No database changes needed - use localStorage for theme preferences initially**  
**Future Intent: Implement localStorage-based theme storage, with optional database integration later**  
**Cautionary Notes: Avoid database complexity for initial implementation, keep it simple**  
**Backups: N/A - read-only analysis**  

### 1.4 Create inventory of UI components needing light mode styling ✅
**REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING: /docs/plans/light_mode_implementation/research/1.4_component_inventory.md**  
**Plan Review & Alignment: Identified ~100+ components, prioritized App.tsx removal of forced dark mode**  
**Future Intent: Focus on core layout first, then expand to specialized components**  
**Cautionary Notes: App.tsx currently forces dark mode - must be addressed first**  
**Backups: N/A - read-only analysis**  

## 2. Planning Phase ✅

### 2.1 Design ThemeContext architecture and integration ✅
**REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING: /docs/plans/light_mode_implementation/research/2.1_context_architecture_plan.md**  
**Plan Review & Alignment: Designed React Context following existing AuthContext/DatabaseContext patterns with localStorage persistence and system detection**  
**Future Intent: Create ThemeProvider wrapper around entire app, implement useTheme hook with memoization for performance**  
**Cautionary Notes: Must ensure no conflicts with forced dark mode in App.tsx, need proper hydration to prevent FOWT**  
**Backups: N/A - design only**  

### 2.2 Create complete mapping of dark to light theme CSS variables ✅
**REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING: /docs/plans/light_mode_implementation/research/2.2_css_variable_mapping.md**  
**Plan Review & Alignment: Complete WCAG AA compliant mapping, 21:1 contrast for text, all chart colors accessible for color blindness**  
**Future Intent: Implement .light class system with CSS variable overrides, maintain brand consistency with blue theme**  
**Cautionary Notes: Chart colors need 3:1+ contrast, test extensively with accessibility tools before deployment**  
**Backups: N/A - design document only**  

### 2.3 Design theme toggle component API and integration points ✅
**REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING: /docs/plans/light_mode_implementation/research/2.3_component_api_design.md**  
**Plan Review & Alignment: Designed flexible component with 4 variants, full accessibility support, follows Shadcn UI patterns**  
**Future Intent: Create reusable component for header, sidebar, and settings integration with proper ARIA labels**  
**Cautionary Notes: Must ensure keyboard navigation works properly, test screen reader announcements thoroughly**  
**Backups: N/A - design specification only**  

## 3. Design Phase ✅

### 3.1 Create light theme color palette specification with WCAG compliance ✅
**REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING: /docs/plans/light_mode_implementation/research/3.1_light_theme_color_palette.md**  
**Plan Review & Alignment: Completed comprehensive color palette design with WCAG AA compliance and accessibility testing**  
**Future Intent: Use defined color palette for all light mode CSS variables and component styling**  
**Cautionary Notes: Must maintain contrast ratios and accessibility standards**  
**Backups: N/A - design document only**  

### 3.2 Update CSS variables with light mode definitions ✅
**REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING: /docs/plans/light_mode_implementation/research/3.2_css_implementation_completed.md**  
**Plan Review & Alignment: Successfully implemented light mode as default in src/index.css with enhanced dark mode support**  
**Future Intent: CSS infrastructure now ready for ThemeContext implementation**  
**Cautionary Notes: Backup created in ./backups/ directory - can rollback if needed**  
**Backups: ./backups/index_css_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.css**  

### 3.3 Design component visual specifications for light mode ✅
**REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING: /docs/plans/light_mode_implementation/research/3.3_component_visual_specifications.md**  
**Plan Review & Alignment: Created comprehensive visual specifications for all UI components in light mode**  
**Future Intent: Use specifications as guide for implementing theme switching and testing**  
**Cautionary Notes: Must follow accessibility guidelines and maintain design consistency**  
**Backups: N/A - design document only**
