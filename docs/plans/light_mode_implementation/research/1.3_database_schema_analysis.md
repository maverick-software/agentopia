# Database Schema Analysis for Theme Preferences
*Research Document for WBS Task 1.3*

## Executive Summary
The current Agentopia database schema does not include dedicated theme preference storage. Theme preferences should be implemented using localStorage for immediate implementation, with optional database integration for future user profile enhancements.

## Current Database State

### User-Related Tables
1. **`auth.users`** - Standard Supabase authentication table
2. **`public.user_profiles`** - Contains basic profile information:
   - `id` (uuid, PK, FK -> auth.users.id)
   - `username` (text)
   - `full_name` (text) 
   - `avatar_url` (text)
   - `updated_at` (timestamptz)

### Relevant Findings
- **No Theme Preferences**: Current schema has no theme or UI preference storage
- **Profile System**: Basic user profiles exist but are minimal
- **Archived Code**: Found evidence of `UserPreferences` interface in archived workflow migration code that included theme preferences, but not implemented in active codebase

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: localStorage Implementation ✅ (Recommended)
- **Rationale**: Fastest implementation, no database changes required
- **Storage**: Use `localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light|dark|system')`
- **Benefits**: 
  - Immediate implementation
  - No database migration required
  - Works offline
  - Fast performance

### Phase 2: Database Integration ⏸️ (Future Enhancement)
- **Rationale**: Better user experience across devices
- **Implementation**: Add `preferences` jsonb column to `user_profiles`
- **Benefits**:
  - Cross-device synchronization
  - Better analytics
  - More robust user experience

## Database Migration (Future)
If database storage is needed later, the migration would be:

```sql
-- Add preferences column to user_profiles
ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles 
ADD COLUMN preferences jsonb DEFAULT '{}';

-- Update RLS policies if needed
-- (Policies would need to be reviewed for preferences access)
```

## Integration Points

### Current Authentication Flow
- Users authenticate via Supabase Auth
- Profile created/updated in `user_profiles` table
- Theme preference would be in localStorage initially

### Future Database Integration
- Theme preferences would sync to `user_profiles.preferences`
- Could include: `{"theme": "light", "language": "en", "timezone": "UTC"}`
- Would require API endpoints for preference CRUD operations

## Constraints & Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies must be considered for any new preference columns
- Supabase real-time subscriptions may be needed for cross-tab synchronization
- Migration strategy needed if moving from localStorage to database

### User Experience Constraints
- Must maintain theme selection during the transition period
- Should not require users to reconfigure preferences
- Must handle offline scenarios gracefully

## Conclusion
**Recommended Approach**: Implement theme preferences using localStorage for initial release. Database integration can be added later as an enhancement without breaking existing functionality.

**Files to Monitor**: 
- `src/types/database.types.ts` - Database type definitions
- `supabase/migrations/` - Future migrations
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication integration points

**Risk Level**: Low - localStorage implementation is proven and reliable for theme preferences.
