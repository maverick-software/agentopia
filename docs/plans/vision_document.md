I want to be able to deploy a server for a client, create agents for them, create chat rooms for their teams, like the 'marketing' chatroom. It can have its own channels and such. they can invite any agent their account is authorized to use.

If I am an Agent-as-a-Service (AaaS), I need a way to quickly create, deploy and manage unique agents for a business. I will need a way for their team to be able to access those agents, which will require an internet access, unless we set it up on premises. Except that I want people to be able to access their agents via a phone app and web app too.

However, these agents will need to be able to work inside of a desktop environment, so I will need to choose whether to deploy these on to a virtual desktop environment, or allow them to work on the users desktop environment.

This means we will need the ability to set left and right boundaries for agents, and give them access to groups of admin tools on a desktop. For example, maybe they only have access to create a document, or search the web, but maybe others have expertise and ability to set system policies (this will be way later).

(The real question is, how simple are these tasks people do, really? Answer phones? respond to emails? Create appointments? A lot of the work can be done via the server we place them on.)

So the user gets an account, they get a link on their desktop, they open it, login and they see their assigned chat server with their chatrooms and their agents.

The management team will have access maybe to create their own agents/teams and workflows/tasks if they choose, outside the agents the AaaS creates for them. There will be boilerplate agents that perform specific tasks, we will keep them updated. They can order custom agents and workflows or make them themselves. They can create tools (basically forms with inputs for an agent to complete a task. Backend customized prompts). 

Agentopia becomes this badass platform where administration can create virtual employees and mix them with real world employees in chatrooms to perform tasks. We will add a simple project management interface as well, so humans or agents can create a project and manage it to completion.

additionally, they can invite agents from other platforms if they have the webhooks or A2A protocol. Agentopia agents will be empowered through MCP servers we make available through a repository. They can use ours, which will have use limits, or they can opt to spin deploy them on a Digital Ocean droplet for a monthly fee. This process would happen completely inside our platform, and they would only know the price difference.

Agent token and tool usage will need to be monitored on the backend to ensure profitability. 

Specialized agents will need access to platforms and localized tools. This should be handled by a separation of concerns as well. A single agents should only be responsible for the most atomic task in a chain of events. This ensures operational boundaries, better contextual processing and better quality control through additional feedback loops.

Chat Rooms

Do Chat Rooms need to be deployed on a special Chat Room server? It does consume resources (memory, compute and storage), so if this is a SaaS, then yes, but if not, a local machine should be able to handle it.

Database Management

We will need centralized data management for alot of chat history to ensure we are providing the best use cases for our clients. This means a growing and cascading vector database that may operate in layers of memory. For example, 

The software itself needs to understand how to deploy a database, this way if we want to choose to deploy it in a cloud environment, we can use LLM providers, netlify, supabase and digitalocean; however, if we want to deploy it locally on a system, we want to be able to choose a local AI modal, local database options, and local server deployment as well. This begs the question of whether a docker deployment is the right option. it is probably best to come out of the box with a local database setup, and with the option to deploy it in the cloud as well.

We should be able to define local system addresses to find local LLMs, local DBs, etc. in case the user wants a robust internal network to avoid high usage costs. The thing is, do we ship the hardware? Maybe we ship a rack mount or something and access it remotely.
