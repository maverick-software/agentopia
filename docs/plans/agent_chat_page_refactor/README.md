## 🎯 Quick Summary

### **The Problem**
Loading spinner gets stuck after sending the first message in a new conversation.

### **Root Cause**
- Over-complicated state management with 7+ state variables
- Race conditions between state updates and effects
- `isHistoryLoading` set to `true` but not always cleared
- Multiple early returns in `fetchHistory` without cleanup

### **The Solution**
Replace complex multi-flag system with a simple state machine:
```typescript
type ConversationLifecycle = 
  | { status: 'none' }                    // Clean slate
  | { status: 'creating', tempId: string} // Sending first message
  | { status: 'active', id: string }      // Active conversation
```
