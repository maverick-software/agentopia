## Phase 1: Research & Planning ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Root Cause Analysis ✅
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Identified core issue as mismatch between UI tracking and untrackable backend process
- **Comprehensive Research**: Applied Five Whys methodology, analyzed current codebase, researched industry patterns
- **Findings**: Problem is architectural - attempting to track real-time progress of atomic backend process
- **Actions**: Documented in `docs/plans/provisioning_timer_fix/research/codebase_analysis.md`
- **Backups**: N/A - research phase
- **Update**: Research complete, root cause identified as design flaw requiring architectural change

### 1.2 Solution Architecture Design ✅
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Designed status-based masking approach aligned with industry best practices
- **Comprehensive Research**: Analyzed AWS, GCP, Heroku patterns for handling unknown duration processes
- **Findings**: Status-based progression is standard approach for unpredictable backend processes
- **Actions**: Created comprehensive solution plan in `docs/plans/provisioning_timer_fix/plan.md`
- **Backups**: N/A - planning phase
- **Update**: Architecture designed, implementation plan approved

## Phase 2: Environment Setup & Backups ⏳ NEXT

### 2.1 Create Backup of Current Implementation
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Backup current ToolboxesPage.tsx before making changes to enable rollback
- **Comprehensive Research**: Current file is 553 lines, timer logic spans lines 63-98 and 198-250
- **Findings**: Key components to backup: timer state, useEffects, helper functions, rendering logic
- **Actions**: Copy `src/pages/ToolboxesPage.tsx` to `docs/plans/provisioning_timer_fix/backups/ToolboxesPage_original.tsx`
- **Backups**: `docs/plans/provisioning_timer_fix/backups/ToolboxesPage_original.tsx`
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

### 2.2 Document Current State for Reference
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Document current timer implementation for comparison and debugging
- **Comprehensive Research**: Need to capture current timer logic, state management, and rendering patterns
- **Findings**: Current implementation uses complex timer state with useEffect dependencies
- **Actions**: Create detailed documentation of current implementation in research folder
- **Backups**: Part of documentation process
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

## Phase 3: Remove Problematic Timer Logic ⏳ PENDING

### 3.1 Remove Complex Timer State
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Remove `provisioningTimers` state that causes infinite re-render loops
- **Comprehensive Research**: State defined on line 35, used in multiple useEffects and rendering logic
- **Findings**: Timer state is root cause of page refresh issues and phase jumping
- **Actions**: 
  - Remove `const [provisioningTimers, setProvisioningTimers] = useState<Record<string, { startTime: Date; remainingSeconds: number }>>({})`
  - Update all references to use simplified approach
- **Backups**: Already created in Phase 2.1
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

### 3.2 Remove Timer Setup useEffect (lines 63-80)
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Remove useEffect that initializes timers for existing provisioning toolboxes
- **Comprehensive Research**: This useEffect adds artificial elapsed time and causes timer jumping
- **Findings**: Creates timers with estimated progress that doesn't match backend reality
- **Actions**: Delete entire useEffect block and related logic
- **Backups**: Already created in Phase 2.1
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

### 3.3 Remove Timer Update useEffect (lines 82-98)
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Remove useEffect that updates timer countdown every second
- **Comprehensive Research**: This creates unnecessary re-renders and complexity
- **Findings**: Timer updates don't provide value since backend progress is unknown
- **Actions**: Delete setInterval-based timer update logic
- **Backups**: Already created in Phase 2.1
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

### 3.4 Remove Timer Helper Functions
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Remove `formatTime`, `getProgressPercentage`, `getDeploymentPhase` functions
- **Comprehensive Research**: Functions on lines 109-135, used only for timer-based display
- **Findings**: Functions will be replaced with status-based equivalents
- **Actions**: Delete helper functions and replace with simplified status-based functions
- **Backups**: Already created in Phase 2.1
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

## Phase 4: Implement Status-Based Display ⏳ PENDING

### 4.1 Create Status-Based Display Function
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Replace timer-based phases with backend status-based display
- **Comprehensive Research**: Need to map backend statuses to user-friendly display messages
- **Findings**: Backend provides: pending_creation, creating, provisioning, awaiting_heartbeat, active
- **Actions**: 
  - Create `getProvisioningDisplay(status: string)` function
  - Map statuses to appropriate phases and progress percentages
  - Use consistent messaging that doesn't promise specific timing
- **Backups**: Already created in Phase 2.1
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

### 4.2 Update Provisioning Display Component
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Modify rendering logic to use status-based display instead of timer
- **Comprehensive Research**: Current provisioning display starts around line 428
- **Findings**: Need to replace timer-dependent rendering with status-based approach
- **Actions**: 
  - Update provisioning display logic to use `getProvisioningDisplay()` function
  - Remove timer-dependent conditional rendering
  - Keep spinner and progress bar but base on status, not time
- **Backups**: Already created in Phase 2.1
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

### 4.3 Simplify State Management
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Replace complex timer state with simple start time tracking
- **Comprehensive Research**: Only need to track when provisioning started for timeout purposes
- **Findings**: Minimal state required: just start times for new toolboxes
- **Actions**: 
  - Add `const [provisioningStartTimes, setProvisioningStartTimes] = useState<Record<string, Date>>({})`
  - Use only for timeout logic, not progress calculation
- **Backups**: Already created in Phase 2.1
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

## Phase 5: Fix Polling Logic ⏳ PENDING

### 5.1 Remove fetchUserToolboxes from Polling
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Remove the fetchUserToolboxes() call that causes re-renders
- **Comprehensive Research**: Located in startProvisioningStatusCheck function around line 219
- **Findings**: This call triggers component re-renders that break timer continuity
- **Actions**: 
  - Replace `await fetchUserToolboxes()` with direct API call
  - Use `await listToolboxes()` directly without updating component state
- **Backups**: Already created in Phase 2.1
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

### 5.2 Implement State-Update-Only-On-Change Logic
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Only update toolboxes state when status actually changes
- **Comprehensive Research**: Current polling updates state on every interval
- **Findings**: Unnecessary state updates cause re-renders and timer resets
- **Actions**: 
  - Compare new status with current status before updating
  - Only call `setToolboxes()` when status actually changes
  - Implement efficient status comparison logic
- **Backups**: Already created in Phase 2.1
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

### 5.3 Optimize Polling Frequency
- **Plan Review & Alignment**: Adjust polling intervals based on status for better UX
- **Comprehensive Research**: Current 15-second interval may be too frequent for some statuses
- **Findings**: Different statuses may need different polling frequencies
- **Actions**: 
  - Use 10 seconds for 'provisioning' status (active phase)
  - Use 20 seconds for 'creating' status (slower phase)
  - Use 30 seconds for 'awaiting_heartbeat' status (almost done)
- **Backups**: Already created in Phase 2.1
- **Update**: [TO BE COMPLETED]
