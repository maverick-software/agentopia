# Additional Improvements: Refresh Button & User-Friendly Errors

## 🔄 **Refresh Button Restored** ✅

### Previous Issue
- Refresh button was only shown for active/error toolboxes
- Users couldn't check progress during provisioning 
- Had to wait for automatic polling to see updates

### Solution Implemented
- **✅ Refresh button now available for ALL toolboxes** (except those being deleted)
- **✅ Context-sensitive tooltips**:
  - Provisioning/Creating: "Check if toolbox setup is complete"
  - Active/Others: "Refresh Status"
- **✅ Smart availability**: Hidden only for deleting/deprovisioned states

### Code Changes
```typescript
// BEFORE: Limited availability
{(toolbox.status === 'active' || toolbox.status.includes('error')) && (

// AFTER: Available for most states
{!toolbox.status.includes('deleting') && toolbox.status !== 'deprovisioned' && (
```

## 🎯 **User-Friendly Error Messages** ✅

### Previous Issue
- Technical error messages like "500 Internal Server Error"
- No guidance on what users should do
- Harsh red styling created panic

### Solution Implemented
- **✅ Smart error interpretation** with `getUserFriendlyErrorMessage()` function
- **✅ Context-aware messaging** based on toolbox status
- **✅ Actionable guidance** for users
- **✅ Friendly orange styling** with helpful icons

### Message Examples

**API/Server Errors During Provisioning:**
> "Your toolbox is still being set up. This can take 3-5 minutes. Please wait a few moments and refresh to check the status."

**General Server Issues:**
> "There was a temporary server issue. Please wait a moment and try refreshing the status."

**Timeout Errors:**
> "The request took longer than expected. Your toolbox may still be setting up. Please wait about 5 minutes and check back."

**Authentication Issues:**
> "Your session may have expired. Please refresh the page and try again."

**Unknown Errors:**
> "Something went wrong. If your toolbox was provisioning, please wait about 5 minutes for it to complete, then refresh the status."

## ⏱️ **Timeout Warning System** ✅

### New Feature
- **✅ 10-minute timeout detection** for provisioning toolboxes
- **✅ Visual warning** when setup takes longer than expected
- **✅ Guidance to refresh status** for progress check

### Implementation
```typescript
const isProvisioningTimedOut = (toolboxName: string): boolean => {
  const startTime = provisioningStartTimes[toolboxName];
  if (!startTime) return false;
  const elapsed = new Date().getTime() - startTime.getTime();
  return elapsed > 600000; // 10 minutes
};
```

**Visual Display:**
```
⏱️ This is taking longer than usual. You can refresh the status to check progress.
```

## 🎨 **Improved Error Styling** ✅

### Before: Harsh Red Alerts
```typescript
<p className="text-xs text-red-400 bg-red-900/20 p-2 rounded my-2">
  Error: {technicalErrorMessage}
</p>
```

### After: Friendly Orange Guidance
```typescript
<div className="text-xs text-orange-400 bg-orange-900/20 p-3 rounded-lg my-2 border border-orange-800/30">
  <div className="flex items-start">
    <span className="text-orange-300 mr-2">⚠️</span>
    <div>
      <p className="font-medium text-orange-300 mb-1">Setup Issue Detected</p>
      <p className="text-orange-400/80 mb-2">{friendlyMessage}</p>
      <p className="text-xs text-orange-400/60">💡 Tip: Most setup issues resolve themselves within 5 minutes. Try refreshing the status.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
