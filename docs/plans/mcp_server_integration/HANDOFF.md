# MCP Server Integration Project - Developer Handoff

**Date:** June 5, 2025 12:30:00.00  
**Project:** MCP Server Integration  
**Protocol:** @plan_and_execute.mdc  
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks (3 phases)  
**Current Status:** Phase 1 Research - 40% Complete  
**Architecture:** Multi-MCP Server Toolboxes with OAuth Integration  
**Major Update:** Added comprehensive authentication storage and OAuth integration  

## Executive Summary

This project transforms Agentopia's existing Docker-based toolbox infrastructure into autonomous agent empowerment platforms by integrating multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers per toolbox. Each toolbox becomes a multi-MCP server hosting environment where agents are granted access to toolboxes, then granted granular access to specific tools within those MCP servers.

**Key Insight:** Agentopia's current infrastructure is 95% ready for MCP integration, positioning us as first-to-market with user-owned autonomous agent infrastructure where agents can access curated tool ecosystems.

**Architecture Clarification:** Toolboxes are DigitalOcean servers hosting multiple MCP servers in Docker containers. Agents receive access grants to toolboxes, then tool-level access grants within those environments. Open source MCP servers will be refactored for this multi-tenant, access-controlled hosting model.

## Technical Implementation Insights

### Multi-MCP Server Architecture Strategy
**✅ CONFIRMED: Multiple MCP servers per toolbox is optimal architecture**
- Each toolbox (DigitalOcean droplet) hosts 5-10 specialized MCP servers in Docker containers
- Container isolation maintains security while sharing base system resources
- Docker networking enables seamless inter-container communication
- Resource allocation managed per-container with Docker limits
- Functional separation: database-mcp, file-system-mcp, git-mcp, slack-mcp, etc.

### Database Integration Strategy
- Extend existing `account_tool_instances` table for multiple MCP servers per toolbox
- Link `mcp_servers` table to toolbox infrastructure with one-to-many relationships
- Leverage existing agent framework relationships for granular access control
- Enhance `agent_toolbox_access` for toolbox-level permissions
- Extend `agent_toolbelt_items` for tool-level access within MCP servers
- **NEW: Add authentication storage tables for secure credential management**
- **NEW: Add OAuth provider configuration tables**
- **NEW: Add agent permission matrix for granular account access control**
- **NEW: Add security audit trail tables for compliance**
- Minimal schema changes required due to excellent foundation

### DTMA Enhancement Strategy
- Add multi-MCP server container orchestration per toolbox
- Implement MCP protocol health checks across multiple servers
- Extend status reporting for collective MCP server monitoring
- Add container networking for inter-MCP server communication
- Implement resource allocation across multiple MCP servers
- Support for open source MCP server deployment and configuration
- **NEW: Add secure credential injection for MCP server authentication**

- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Agents require explicit permission for each account connection
- Estimated effort: 10-12 days

### Security Model
- **No changes needed** - existing security is sufficient
- User isolation through dedicated toolboxes
- Row Level Security (RLS) provides database access control
- Vault integration for API key management
- Container isolation for MCP server security
