- [ ] Tool discovery latency <5 seconds across multiple MCP servers
- [ ] Agent-to-toolbox-to-MCP communication maintains real-time responsiveness
- [ ] Agent-to-user account access latency <2 seconds
- [ ] 100% audit trail coverage for agent account access
- [ ] Zero security incidents with credential management

## Notes and Updates

### Architecture Updates
- **Multi-MCP Server Architecture**: Updated plan to reflect toolboxes hosting multiple specialized MCP servers per environment for optimal resource utilization and functional separation
- **Agent Access Control Hierarchy**: Implemented granular access control: Agent → Toolbox → MCP Server → Tool for enterprise-grade security
- **Authentication Integration**: Added comprehensive OAuth 2.0/OIDC integration with secure credential storage for agent-to-user account access
- **Open Source Integration**: Plan now includes refactoring existing open source MCP servers for multi-tenant hosting environment

### Security Enhancements
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All user credentials encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Zero-Trust Access Model**: Agents require explicit permission for each level of access
- **Audit Trail System**: Complete logging of all agent-to-user account interactions
- **OAuth Compliance**: Industry-standard OAuth 2.0/OIDC implementation with automatic token refresh

*This section will be updated as each task is completed with specific implementation notes, lessons learned, and any deviations from the original plan.*
