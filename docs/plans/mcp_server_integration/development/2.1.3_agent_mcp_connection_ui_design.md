## UI Design Specifications

### 1. Connection Topology View

**Primary Interface - Network Graph Visualization**

The main interface presents a dynamic network topology showing agents, MCP servers, and their interconnections in real-time. This "god's eye view" enables operators to understand system state at a glance while providing drill-down capabilities for detailed management.

**Visual Design Specifications:**

*Color Scheme:*
- Background: Dark navy (#0f1419) for reduced eye strain
- Active connections: Electric blue (#00d4ff) to cyan (#7c3aed)
- Healthy status: Emerald green (#10b981)
- Warning states: Amber yellow (#f59e0b)
- Error states: Red (#ef4444)
- Inactive/disabled: Gray (#6b7280)

*Node Design:*
- Agents: Circular with type-specific icons, glowing borders for activity
- MCP Servers: Rounded rectangles with capability badges
- Toolboxes: Hexagonal shapes to differentiate from direct connections
- Size scaling: 24px (small), 32px (medium), 48px (large) base sizes

*Connection Design:*
- Line thickness: 1px (idle), 3px (active), 5px (high traffic)
- Animated particles flow from source to target during active communication
- Curved paths for visual clarity when lines would overlap
- Connection labels show protocol type (HTTP, WebSocket, etc.)

### 2. Agent Status Dashboard

**Real-time Agent Monitoring Panel**

Located in the left sidebar, this panel provides comprehensive monitoring of all active agents, their current status, resource utilization, and connection health. The dashboard uses card-based layout for easy scanning and includes quick action controls.

**Key Components:**
- Agent overview metrics (total agents, active connections, error rates)
- Individual agent status cards with performance indicators
- Resource utilization graphs and sparklines
- Quick action buttons for common management tasks
- Alert notifications for issues requiring attention

### 3. MCP Server Monitoring Panel

**Server Health and Capability Tracking**

The right sidebar displays detailed information about all connected MCP servers, including health metrics, available capabilities, and current load. This panel enables proactive monitoring and capacity planning.

**Key Features:**
- Server health indicators with uptime and performance metrics
- Capability listings with availability status
- Connected agent summaries
- Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, connections)
- Server management controls and configuration access

### 4. Real-time Connection Management

**Interactive Connection Controls**

The bottom panel provides detailed views of active connections, including real-time metrics, message flow visualization, and direct control options. This enables immediate response to connection issues.

**Core Functionality:**
- Live connection metrics (latency, throughput, error rates)
- Message flow animation showing data direction and volume
- Connection controls (pause, resume, terminate, inspect)
- Failed connection management with retry options
- Connection queue status for pending establishments

### 5. Event Log and Notification System

**Centralized Activity Monitoring**

A collapsible event log panel captures all system activities, providing filterable, searchable access to connection events, errors, and system changes. Smart notifications ensure critical issues receive immediate attention.

**Features:**
- Real-time event streaming with severity-based coloring
- Advanced filtering by time, source, type, and severity
- Contextual actions for each event type
- Notification settings with rate limiting
- Event acknowledgment and resolution tracking
