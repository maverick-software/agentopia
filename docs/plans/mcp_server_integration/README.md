# MCP Server Integration Project

**Transform Docker environments into full AI agent platforms through Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration.**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project integrates Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into Agentopia's existing Docker-based toolbox infrastructure, enabling users to deploy and manage their own MCP servers for AI agent enhancement.

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks (3 phases)  
**Protocol:** @plan_and_execute.mdc  
**Current Status:** Phase 1 Complete ✅ - Ready for Phase 2 Development
