**Date:** September 10, 2025  
**Plan ID:** microsoft_outlook_integration_completion  
**Protocol:** Plan & Execute  

## Project Phases

### 1. RESEARCH PHASE

#### 1.1 Microsoft Graph API Research
- [x] Research Microsoft Graph API endpoints for email operations
  - **Status:** COMPLETED
  - **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [docs/plans/microsoft_outlook_integration_completion/research/1.1_microsoft_graph_email_api_research.md]
  - **Plan Review & Alignment:** ✅ Reviewed Microsoft Graph email endpoints (/me/sendMail, /me/messages) and confirmed alignment with existing Gmail patterns. Different payload structure but similar OAuth flow.
  - **Future Intent:** ✅ Use research to implement sendEmail, getEmails, and searchEmails functions with proper error handling and LLM-friendly messages
  - **Cautionary Notes:** ✅ Graph API uses different payload structure than Gmail - nested message object with toRecipients array. Rate limiting is stricter (10k/10min). Token refresh is critical.
  - **Backups:** [TBD - will backup files during implementation]

- [x] Research Microsoft Graph API endpoints for calendar operations
  - **Status:** COMPLETED
  - **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [docs/plans/microsoft_outlook_integration_completion/research/1.2_microsoft_graph_calendar_api_research.md]
  - **Plan Review & Alignment:** ✅ Reviewed calendar endpoints (/me/events) with comprehensive event structure including recurrence patterns, timezone handling, and attendee management
  - **Future Intent:** ✅ Use research to implement createCalendarEvent and getCalendarEvents with proper timezone handling and recurrence support
  - **Cautionary Notes:** ✅ Timezone handling is critical - must use IANA timezone names. Recurrence patterns are complex. Attendee management requires careful email validation.
  - **Backups:** [TBD - will backup files during implementation]

- [x] Research Microsoft Graph API endpoints for contact operations
  - **Status:** COMPLETED
  - **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [docs/plans/microsoft_outlook_integration_completion/research/1.3_microsoft_graph_contacts_api_research.md]
  - **Plan Review & Alignment:** ✅ Reviewed contacts endpoints (/me/contacts) with comprehensive contact properties including addresses, phone numbers, and professional information
  - **Future Intent:** ✅ Use research to implement getContacts, createContact, and searchContacts with proper data validation and duplicate detection
  - **Cautionary Notes:** ✅ Contact data includes sensitive personal information - must handle privacy appropriately. Duplicate detection is important. Email/phone validation required.
  - **Backups:** [TBD - will backup files during implementation]

- [x] Research error handling patterns and rate limiting for Microsoft Graph
  - **Status:** COMPLETED
  - **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [docs/plans/microsoft_outlook_integration_completion/research/1.4_microsoft_graph_error_handling_rate_limiting_research.md]
  - **Plan Review & Alignment:** ✅ Reviewed comprehensive error handling patterns, rate limiting (10k/10min), retry strategies with exponential backoff, and LLM-friendly error transformations
  - **Future Intent:** ✅ Implement robust error handling with retry logic, circuit breaker pattern, and LLM-friendly error messages aligned with existing Agentopia patterns
  - **Cautionary Notes:** ✅ Rate limits are strict and vary by API (calendar: 1.5k/30s, contacts: 800/30s). Must implement exponential backoff. Token refresh is critical for long operations.
  - **Backups:** [TBD - will backup files during implementation]

#### 1.2 Existing Integration Pattern Analysis
- [x] Analyze Gmail API integration patterns for reference
  - **Status:** COMPLETED
  - **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [docs/plans/microsoft_outlook_integration_completion/research/1.5_existing_integration_patterns_analysis.md]
  - **Plan Review & Alignment:** ✅ Analyzed Gmail API structure (918 lines single file), request/response patterns, authentication via Supabase Vault, and LLM-friendly error messages
  - **Future Intent:** ✅ Apply Gmail patterns to Outlook but modularize into smaller files (200-300 lines each) and adapt for Microsoft Graph API structure
  - **Cautionary Notes:** ✅ Gmail uses single large file (918 lines) - must split Outlook into modules. Graph API has different payload structure than Gmail API. Must follow exact same authentication and error handling patterns.
  - **Backups:** [TBD - will backup files during implementation]

- [x] Review Universal Tool Executor routing patterns
  - **Status:** COMPLETED
  - **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [docs/plans/microsoft_outlook_integration_completion/research/1.5_existing_integration_patterns_analysis.md]
  - **Plan Review & Alignment:** ✅ Reviewed TOOL_ROUTING_MAP pattern with prefix matching, action mapping, and parameter transformation. Clear pattern for adding 'outlook_' prefix tools
  - **Future Intent:** ✅ Add 'outlook_' routing configuration to Universal Tool Executor with proper action mapping and parameter transformation
  - **Cautionary Notes:** ✅ Must follow exact parameter mapping pattern. Gmail uses 'params' wrapper, SMTP uses different structure. Must ensure consistent error enhancement patterns.
  - **Backups:** [TBD - will backup files during implementation]

- [x] Analyze integration capabilities database structure
  - **Status:** COMPLETED
  - **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [docs/plans/microsoft_outlook_integration_completion/research/1.5_existing_integration_patterns_analysis.md]
  - **Plan Review & Alignment:** ✅ Analyzed integration_capabilities table structure and pattern for adding tool capabilities. Clear pattern for capability_key, display_label, and display_order
  - **Future Intent:** ✅ Create database migration to add Outlook capabilities following exact same pattern as Gmail and SMTP integrations
  - **Cautionary Notes:** ✅ Must link to correct service_provider by name 'microsoft-outlook'. Display_order must not conflict with existing capabilities. Must follow naming convention exactly.
  - **Backups:** [TBD - will backup files during implementation]

### 2. PLANNING PHASE

  - **Future Intent:** ✅ Implement modular structure to maintain 200-300 line limits while providing complete Microsoft Graph API integration functionality
  - **Cautionary Notes:** ✅ Must maintain exact same authentication patterns as Gmail. Error handling must be LLM-friendly. Graph API client must handle rate limiting properly. Module dependencies must be clear.
