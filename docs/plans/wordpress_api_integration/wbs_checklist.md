# WordPress API Integration - Work Breakdown Structure

## Phase 1: Research (COMPLETED)
- [x] 1.1 Analyze existing integration patterns in Agentopia
- [x] 1.2 Study WordPress REST API documentation and capabilities
- [x] 1.3 Review Supabase Vault security requirements
- [x] 1.4 Examine current service provider architecture

## Phase 2: Planning (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] 2.1 Create comprehensive project plan
- [x] 2.2 Design file structure and component architecture
- [x] 2.3 Define database schema requirements
  - **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [research/2.3_database_schema_research.md]
  - **Plan Review & Alignment:** Leverages existing service_providers and user_integration_credentials tables without modifications. WordPress-specific configuration stored in JSON metadata.
  - **Future Intent:** Single WordPress service provider supports multiple site connections. Extensible for OAuth 2.0 future enhancement.
  - **Cautionary Notes:** Must validate HTTPS requirement for Application Passwords. Site URL validation critical for security.
  - **Backups:** No database modifications required - uses existing schema

- [x] 2.4 Plan authentication flow and security model
  - **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [research/2.4_authentication_security_research.md]
  - **Plan Review & Alignment:** Application Passwords as primary method, following Agentopia's Vault storage pattern. HTTPS enforcement mandatory.
  - **Future Intent:** OAuth 2.0 support planned as future enhancement. Rate limiting and audit logging integrated.
