# Phase 1: Type Definitions Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for the advanced JSON-based chat system. The implementation provides a robust foundation for building a sophisticated memory-aware, state-managed chat architecture.

## Files Created

### 1. Message Types (`message.types.ts`)
- **AdvancedChatMessage**: Core message structure with full metadata, context, and audit support
- **MessageContent**: Flexible content types supporting text, structured data, multimodal, and tool results
- **MessageMetadata**: Comprehensive tracking of model info, performance metrics, and quality scores
- **MessageContext**: Rich context including conversation, semantic analysis, memory references, and state
- **ChatRequestV2/ChatResponseV2**: Structured API interfaces with options for memory, state, and context control

**Key Features:**
- Unique message IDs and versioning
- Tool call integration with status tracking
- Memory reference system
- State snapshot capability
- Audit trail support

### 2. Memory Types (`memory.types.ts`)
- **EpisodicMemory**: Event-based memories with temporal info, importance, and decay
- **SemanticMemory**: Concept/fact storage with relationships and confidence levels
- **ProceduralMemory**: Skill/procedure storage with performance tracking and optimization
- **WorkingMemory**: Active memory management with priority queue and compression

**Key Features:**
- Vector embedding support for similarity search
- Memory decay and importance calculations
- Relationship mapping between concepts
- Performance metrics for procedural memories
- Memory consolidation and pruning policies

### 3. State Types (`state.types.ts`)
- **LocalState**: Agent-specific preferences, patterns, skills, and context
- **SharedState**: Cross-agent knowledge, coordination, and resources
- **SessionState**: Active session tracking with conversation history
- **PersistentState**: Long-term relationships, goals, and evolution tracking

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive preference management
- Pattern learning and skill tracking
- Multi-agent coordination support
- State checkpointing and recovery
- Evolution tracking over time

### 4. Context Types (`context.types.ts`)
- **ContextWindow**: Token-aware context management with segments
- **ContextSegment**: Prioritized, compressible content units
- **CompressionStrategy**: Multiple compression methods (summary, extraction, encoding)
- **OptimizationSettings**: Configurable optimization strategies

**Key Features:**
- Token-based window management
- Priority-based segment selection
- Multiple compression strategies
- Quality metrics and reporting
- Context templates for common scenarios

### 5. Type Guards (`guards.ts`)
- Runtime validation for all major types
- Composite validators for complex structures
- Deep validation system
- Helper guards for common validations

**Key Features:**
- Type-safe runtime checks
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Warning system for non-critical issues
- UUID and timestamp validation

### 6. Utilities (`utils.ts`)
- ID generation (UUID v4 with prefixes)
- Timestamp utilities
- Message creation helpers
- Memory ranking and grouping
- State delta creation and application
- Context efficiency calculations
- Deep clone/merge utilities
- Token estimation

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive helper functions
- Safe JSON operations
- Error response standardization
- Token management utilities
