# Methodology Adherence Notes - Plan and Execute Protocol

## Protocol Compliance Review

### What Was Done Correctly ✅
1. Created proper directory structure at the beginning
2. Conducted comprehensive research (docs 01-04)
3. Created detailed plan.md and wbs_checklist.md
4. Backed up files before modification
5. Implemented solution following research
6. Updated WBS checklist after completion
7. Created implementation documentation

### What Was Initially Missed ❌
1. **Research Document for Task 3.1**: According to Step 3(c)(2) of the protocol, a research document should be created for EACH WBS checklist item BEFORE implementation
2. **WBS Format**: The initial update didn't follow the exact bullet point format specified in Step 3(c)(3)

### Corrections Made ✅
1. Created `3.1_type_definitions_research.md` retroactively
2. Updated WBS checklist with proper format including:
   - REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING
   - Plan Review & Alignment
   - Future Intent
   - Cautionary Notes
   - Backups (with actual timestamp)
   - Actions Taken
   - Reversal Instructions
   - Update

### Lessons Learned
1. **Always create research documents BEFORE implementation** - even for seemingly straightforward tasks
2. **Follow the exact WBS format** specified in the protocol
3. **Use actual timestamps** in backup references, not placeholders
4. **Document reversal instructions** for every implementation

### Going Forward
For all remaining tasks in the WBS:
1. Create research document FIRST
2. Update WBS with "REQUIRED READING" before starting
3. Follow the complete bullet format for documentation
4. Ensure all timestamps are actual, not placeholders

## Protocol Step Reference
From plan_and_execute.mdc Step 3(c):
- **(1) REVIEW AND RESEARCH**: Research each individual task
- **(2) DOCUMENT RESEARCH**: Create reference file in research folder
- Then update WBS checklist with prescribed format

This ensures proper documentation trail and knowledge preservation throughout the project.
