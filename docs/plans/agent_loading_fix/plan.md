# Agent Loading Fix Plan

**Date:** January 10, 2025  
**Issue:** Agents page not rendering agents correctly despite successful data loading

## Problem Analysis

Based on the investigation:
1. The agents page successfully loads 3 agents from the database
2. Debug logs show agents are being rendered (`renderedAgents: Array(3)`)
3. However, the page displays an error message: "Agent not found, access denied, or failed to load"
4. This error message comes from the AgentEditPage component, not AgentsPage
5. This suggests either:
   - A routing issue where the wrong component is rendered
   - A lazy loading issue causing component rendering problems
   - The error might be appearing in a different part of the page

## Proposed File Structure

```
src/
├── pages/
│   ├── AgentsPage.tsx (existing - needs fix)
│   └── agents/
│       └── [agentId]/
│           └── edit.tsx (existing)
├── routing/
│   ├── lazyComponents.ts (existing - may need adjustment)
│   └── routeConfig.tsx (existing)
└── components/
    └── ErrorBoundary.tsx (may need to create)
```

## Root Cause Possibilities

1. **Lazy Loading Issue**: The lazy loading configuration might be causing the wrong component to render
2. **Route Configuration**: The routes might be misconfigured causing overlap
3. **Component Rendering**: The AgentsPage might have a rendering issue that's not visible in the code
4. **Error Boundary**: There might be an error being caught and displayed from another component
