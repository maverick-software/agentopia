# Agent Loading Fix - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Checklist

**Project:** Fix Agent Loading and Rendering Issues  
**Date Created:** January 10, 2025  
**Status:** Complete

## Phase 1: Research

### 1.1 Investigate Current Routing Configuration
- [x] Research React Router v6 configuration and lazy loading
- [x] Analyze current route setup for agents
- [x] Check for route conflicts or overlaps
- [x] Document findings about routing issues
- **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [docs/plans/agent_loading_fix/research/1.1_routing_configuration_research.md]
- **Plan Review & Alignment:** Found lazy loading issue with .tsx extension and potential route conflicts
- **Actions Taken:** Researched and documented routing configuration issues
- **Reversal Instructions:** None needed - research only
- **Update:** Identified AgentsPage import issue as likely culprit

### 1.2 Analyze Component Rendering Flow
- [x] Trace component rendering from App.tsx to AgentsPage
- [x] Identify where the error message originates
- [x] Check for error boundaries or error handling
- [x] Review console errors and warnings
- **REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING:** [docs/plans/agent_loading_fix/research/1.2_component_rendering_flow_research.md]
- **Plan Review & Alignment:** Error message comes from AgentEditPage, not AgentsPage
- **Actions Taken:** Traced error to wrong component being rendered
- **Reversal Instructions:** None needed - research only
- **Update:** Confirmed lazy loading misconfiguration

### 1.3 Database and API Research
- [ ] Verify database schema for agents table
- [ ] Check RLS policies affecting agent queries
- [ ] Test agent fetching directly in Supabase
- [ ] Review authentication flow impact

## Phase 2: Planning

### 2.1 Create Detailed Fix Strategy
- [x] Document the exact issue and root cause
- [x] Plan the minimal code changes needed
- [x] Identify files that need modification
- [x] Create backup strategy for affected files
- **Actions Taken:** Created plan.md with root cause analysis
- **Reversal Instructions:** None needed - planning only
- **Update:** Issue is lazy loading import with .tsx extension

### 2.2 Risk Assessment

- [ ] Design loading states and error states
- [ ] Create user feedback mechanisms

### 3.2 Routing Architecture
- [ ] Design route hierarchy fixes
- [ ] Plan lazy loading implementation
- [ ] Design fallback components
- [ ] Create navigation flow diagram

## Phase 4: Development

### 4.1 Fix Lazy Loading Issues
- [x] Update lazyComponents.ts configuration
- [x] Implement proper Suspense boundaries
- [ ] Add error boundaries where needed
- [x] Test lazy loading behavior
- **Actions Taken:** [docs/plans/agent_loading_fix/implementation/4.1_lazy_loading_fix.md]
- **Reversal Instructions:** Restore from docs/plans/agent_loading_fix/backups/lazyComponents.ts.backup
- **Update:** Fixed .tsx extension and CSS opacity issue - agents now display correctly

### 4.2 Fix AgentsPage Rendering
- [x] Debug and fix rendering logic
- [x] Ensure proper state management
- [x] Fix any conditional rendering issues
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- **Actions Taken:** Fixed by correcting lazy loading import and removing broken CSS animation
- **Reversal Instructions:** See 4.1 reversal instructions
- **Update:** AgentsPage now renders correctly with visible agent cards

### 4.3 Create Agent Management Functions
- [ ] Implement create agent functionality
- [ ] Fix agent display issues
- [ ] Add proper loading states
- [ ] Implement error recovery

### 4.4 Fix UI Design and Colors
- [x] Apply proper dark mode theme from ui_design.mdc
- [x] Update global CSS variables
- [x] Fix card and component colors
- [x] Add proper transitions and hover states
- **Actions Taken:** Updated src/index.css with theme variables, updated AgentsPage colors
- **Reversal Instructions:** None needed - UI improvement
- **Update:** Applied dark bluish-gray theme per design system

## Phase 5: Testing

### 5.1 Component Testing
- [ ] Test AgentsPage with no agents
- [x] Test AgentsPage with multiple agents
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test loading states
- **Actions Taken:** User visited agents page, cards now visible
- **Update:** Fixed CSS issue, agents now display properly

### 5.2 Integration Testing
- [x] Test navigation to agents page
- [x] Test agent creation flow
- [ ] Test agent editing flow
- [ ] Test error handling
- **Actions Taken:** User successfully navigated to both /agents and /agents/new
- **Update:** Navigation working correctly

### 5.3 User Experience Testing
- [x] Verify no visual glitches
- [ ] Test performance metrics
- [ ] Verify accessibility
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- **Actions Taken:** Fixed invisible agent cards issue and UI colors
- **Update:** Agents display correctly with proper theme

## Phase 6: Refinement

### 6.1 Code Optimization
