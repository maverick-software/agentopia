# Bug Report: Docker Container Deployment 404 Error

**Date:** June 19, 2025 - 11:42 AM  
**Reporter:** AI Agent  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Under Investigation  
**Affected Component:** DTMA (Droplet Tool Management Agent) - Container Lifecycle Management  

## Problem Summary

Docker containers are failing to start through the DTMA API with 404 "Not Found" errors, even after successful deployment. The system attempts re-deployment but continues to fail with the same 404 error.

## Error Description

The system is encountering a 404 error when trying to start a previously deployed Docker container via the DTMA API. The error occurs in the `toolbox-tools` Supabase Edge Function when calling DTMA endpoints.

### Primary Error Messages:
```
Error: Container not found in DTMA and re-deployment failed: DTMA API call failed: 404 Not Found - {"error":"Not Found"}
```

```
Error: DTMA API call failed: 404 Not Found - {"error":"Not Found"}
```

## Stack Trace
```
Error stack: Error: Container not found in DTMA and re-deployment failed: DTMA API call failed: 404 Not Found - {"error":"Not Found"}

```

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Container "Context7 MCP Server-1750278276605" should start successfully via DTMA API
2. If container doesn't exist, re-deployment should create and start it successfully
3. Database status should update to 'running'

**Actual Behavior:**
1. Initial start request returns 404 from DTMA
2. Re-deployment attempt also returns 404 from DTMA
3. Database status updates to 'error'
4. User receives deployment failure message

## Reproduction Steps

1. Navigate to MCP server management interface
2. Attempt to deploy a Context7 MCP server 
3. After deployment completes, try to start the server
4. Observe 404 error from DTMA API
5. System attempts automatic re-deployment which also fails with 404

## Environment Details

- **Affected Instance:** Context7 MCP Server-1750278276605
- **Docker Image:** https://github.com/upstash/context7/blob/master/Dockerfile
- **DTMA Health Status:** ✅ Healthy (200 response)
- **DTMA Endpoint:** http://167.99.1.222:30000/tools/
- **Account Tool Instance ID:** b6dcc72b-dfb4-44ae-b330-8ee8bee31a8f

## System State Analysis

### DTMA Health Check Results:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-19T18:37:44.409Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "service": "DTMA",
  "environment": {
    "hasAuthToken": true,
    "hasApiKey": true,
    "hasApiBaseUrl": true,
    "port": "30000"
  }
}
```

### Database Records:
- Tool Instance ID: b6dcc72b-dfb4-44ae-b330-8ee8bee31a8f
- Status progression: pending_deploy → deploying → starting → error
- Instance Name: "Context7 MCP Server-1750278276605"

## Critical Questions for Investigation

1. **Why is the DTMA returning 404 for deployed containers?**
2. **Is there a mismatch between the container management and the DTMA routes?**
3. **Are containers actually being created during the deployment phase?**
4. **Is there a persistence issue between deployment and lifecycle management?**
5. **Are the URL encoding/decoding causing route resolution issues?**

## Evidence Gathered

### Logs Analysis:
- DTMA health check passes successfully
- Deployment phase returns "accepted" status
- Container start phase fails with 404
- Re-deployment also fails with 404

### Code Analysis:
- `toolbox-tools` function uses URL encoding for container names
- DTMA routes expect exact container name matching
- There's a `managedInstances` Map used for container tracking

## Initial Assessment

**Severity:** High - Blocks MCP server deployment functionality
**Impact:** Users cannot successfully deploy and start MCP servers
**Root Cause Hypothesis:** Container state management discrepancy between deployment and lifecycle operations

## Next Steps

1. **Analyze DTMA container state management**
2. **Investigate the `managedInstances` persistence mechanism**
3. **Verify URL encoding/decoding consistency**
4. **Check if containers exist at Docker level but not in DTMA tracking**
5. **Examine the deployment success vs. actual container creation**
