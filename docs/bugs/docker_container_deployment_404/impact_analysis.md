## 🔧 Technical Dependency Impact

### **Upstream Dependencies**
**Impact Level:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**

1. **Docker Engine on Droplets**
   - Status: ✅ Functional (containers can be created manually)
   - Impact: No direct impact, but indirectly affected by management layer

2. **DigitalOcean Infrastructure**
   - Status: ✅ Functional (droplets running normally)
   - Impact: No direct impact on infrastructure layer

3. **Supabase Edge Functions**
   - Status: ⚠️ Partially Functional (functions work, but DTMA calls fail)
   - Impact: Edge functions become error-prone due to DTMA failures

### **Downstream Dependencies**
**Impact Level:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**

1. **Frontend MCP Management Interface**
   - Status: ❌ Broken (shows deployment failures)
   - Impact: Users cannot successfully deploy or manage MCP servers

2. **Database State Management**
   - Status: ⚠️ Inconsistent (status updates to 'error' state)
   - Impact: Database contains stale/incorrect container states

3. **Tool Instance Lifecycle**
   - Status: ❌ Broken (cannot start/stop/manage containers)
   - Impact: Complete loss of container management capability

4. **User Workflows**
   - Status: ❌ Blocked (MCP deployment workflow fails)
   - Impact: Core platform functionality unavailable
