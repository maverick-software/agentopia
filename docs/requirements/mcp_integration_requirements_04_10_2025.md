# Agentopia MCP Integration Requirements - 04/10/2025

Based on:
- `.cursor/rules/project/agentopia-mcp-implementation-plan.mdc`
- Model Context Protocol Specification (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/)

## 1. Agent Configuration

- **REQ-MCP-CONF-01:** Implement a UI element (e.g., toggle switch) within the agent settings panel to enable or disable MCP client functionality for that agent.
- **REQ-MCP-CONF-02:** Provide a UI section within agent settings to add, view, edit, and delete MCP server configurations.
- **REQ-MCP-CONF-03:** Each MCP server configuration must include:
    - Name (User-defined identifier)
    - Endpoint URL
    - API Key (Optional, stored securely)
    - Timeout (ms)
    - Max Retries
    - Retry Backoff (ms)
    - Priority (for multiple servers)
    - Active/Inactive status
- **REQ-MCP-CONF-04:** Store MCP configurations persistently, linked to the specific agent. The database schema should align with the `mcp_configurations` and `mcp_servers` tables proposed in the implementation plan.
- **REQ-MCP-CONF-05:** Implement secure storage and handling for MCP server API keys.
- **REQ-MCP-CONF-06:** Provide a UI mechanism to test the connection to a configured MCP server.

## 2. Server Communication (Model Context Protocol)

- **REQ-MCP-COMM-01:** Implement an MCP client component capable of establishing and managing JSON-RPC connections to configured MCP servers.
- **REQ-MCP-COMM-02:** The client must handle the MCP startup sequence, including capability negotiation (`initialize` request/response) with the server.
- **REQ-MCP-COMM-03:** The client must be able to dynamically determine which context information (e.g., agent personality, current conversation, user profile) to package and send to the server based on negotiated capabilities and server requirements.
- **REQ-MCP-COMM-04:** The client must support sending context information via relevant MCP methods (e.g., providing `mcp/resources`).
- **REQ-MCP-COMM-05:** The client must be able to receive and parse responses from the MCP server, including potential resource updates or requests to execute tools (`mcp/tools`).
- **REQ-MCP-COMM-06:** Implement logic to handle potential MCP features like prompts (`mcp/prompts`) if deemed necessary during design/development.
- **REQ-MCP-COMM-07:** The client must correctly handle MCP error responses and implement retry logic as per configuration.
- **REQ-MCP-COMM-08:** Implement server capability discovery (e.g., querying the server after initialization) and potentially display these capabilities in the UI.

## 3. Integration within Agentopia

- **REQ-MCP-INT-01:** Integrate the MCP client component into the agent's primary execution workflow/pipeline.
- **REQ-MCP-INT-02:** When an agent task is initiated (e.g., processing a user message), if MCP is enabled, the agent should interact with its configured and active MCP servers.
- **REQ-MCP-INT-03:** The order of interaction with multiple MCP servers should be determined by the configured priority.
- **REQ-MCP-INT-04:** Results/context obtained from MCP servers should be made available to the agent's core logic (e.g., LLM prompt augmentation, tool execution).
- **REQ-MCP-INT-05:** Implement robust logging for all significant MCP client actions (connection, negotiation, requests, responses, errors).
- **REQ-MCP-INT-06:** Define how MCP server interactions affect agent response time and implement mechanisms (e.g., timeouts, asynchronous processing) to manage this.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **REQ-MCP-NFR-01:** Performance: MCP interactions should not introduce unacceptable latency to the agent's response time.
- **REQ-MCP-NFR-02:** Scalability: The system should handle multiple agents concurrently interacting with their respective MCP servers.
- **REQ-MCP-NFR-03:** Security: API keys and sensitive configuration must be stored and transmitted securely.
- **REQ-MCP-NFR-04:** Reliability: Connection issues and server errors should be handled gracefully with configured retries.
