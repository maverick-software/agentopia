# Next Steps - 20250729_080841

This document outlines the recommended next steps for the Agentopia project.

## Immediate Priorities

*   **Review Project Backlog**: The next agent should review the project backlog and active development plans to identify the next set of priorities. There are no immediate pending tasks from the previous session.

## Recommended Focus Areas

*   **Comprehensive Logging System**: The `README.md` file notes the need for a comprehensive logging system. This is a critical feature for monitoring and debugging the platform, and should be prioritized.
*   **Refactor Large Files**: Several files in the codebase have been identified as being too large and in need of refactoring. This will improve code quality and maintainability.
*   **Improve Tokenizer**: The current context builder uses a basic character count for token estimation. Replacing this with `tiktoken` will improve accuracy and performance.
*   **Team Membership Access**: The `fetchWorkspaces` hook does not currently grant workspace access based on team membership. This should be enhanced to provide more flexible access control.

## Future Development

*   **Continue MCP Management Interface**: The `README.md` notes that the MCP management interface is partially complete. This should be a focus for future development.
*   **Finalize Admin Marketplace Management**: The admin interface for managing the marketplace should be completed.
*   **Thorough Testing**: Continue thorough testing of all features, especially the workspace collaboration tools.
