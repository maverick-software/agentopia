# Progress Summary: GitHub Actions Build Failure Resolution

**Timestamp:** 2025-06-03_15-25-55

## Task Focus
Resolving GitHub Actions build failure for the DTMA (Droplet Tool Management Agent) service.

## Key Accomplishments in this Session

1.  **Workflow Path Correction:**
    *   **Issue:** Docker build context path in `dtma/.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` was incorrect, leading to "path not found" errors.
    *   **Resolution:** Corrected `context` to `.` and `file` to `./Dockerfile` as the workflow executes from within the `dtma/` directory.
    *   **Status:** ✅ Fixed and Pushed.

2.  **TypeScript Compilation Error Resolution:**
    *   **Issue:** `npm run build` (executing `tsc`) failed within the Docker build due to 14 TypeScript errors in `dtma/src/`.
    *   **Resolution:** Systematically fixed all 14 errors related to missing imports/exports, incorrect function signatures, type mismatches, and unused variables.
        *   Files modified: `dtma/src/index.ts`, `dtma/src/docker_manager.ts`, `dtma/src/routes/tool_routes.ts`.
        *   Backups created in `docs/plans/github_actions_build_failure/backups/`.
    *   **Local Verification:** `npm run build` confirmed successful in the local `dtma/` directory.
    *   **Status:** ✅ Fixed and Pushed.

3.  **Documentation & Protocol Adherence:**
    *   Maintained and updated the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for this task: `docs/plans/github_actions_build_failure/wbs_checklist.md`.
    *   Created other planning documents (bug report, analysis, etc.) as part of the troubleshooting protocol.
    *   Followed backup procedures for modified code.

## Current State of the Build Issue

*   All identified root causes for the build failure (workflow path and TypeScript errors) are believed to be resolved.
*   The latest code containing all fixes has been pushed to `origin/main`.
*   The GitHub Actions workflow for the DTMA service was automatically triggered and is **currently running**.

## WBS Progress

*   Currently in **Phase 3: Development and Implementation**, specifically **Task 3.3: Phase 1 Testing and Verification**.
*   Completed sub-tasks related to identifying and fixing the build context and TypeScript errors.
*   Awaiting results of the latest GitHub Actions build to complete the remaining sub-tasks in 3.3 (verify success, image publication, etc.).
