# Next Steps: GitHub Actions Build Failure Resolution

**Timestamp:** 2025-06-03_15-25-55

This document outlines the immediate next steps for resolving the GitHub Actions build failure for the DTMA service, following the fixes implemented in the current session.

## Immediate Next Steps (from WBS Task 3.3)

1.  **Monitor Current GitHub Actions Workflow:**
    *   **Action:** Observe the currently running GitHub Actions workflow for the `dtma/docker-build.yml` (triggered by the latest push containing path and TypeScript fixes).
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The workflow completes successfully without any build or push errors.
    *   **WBS Reference:** Subtask 3.3.3: Verify workflow completes without errors.

2.  **Verify Image in GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):
    *   **Action:** If the workflow succeeds, navigate to the GitHub Container Registry for the repository.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Confirm that the DTMA Docker image (e.g., `ghcr.io/maverick-software/agentopia/dtma` or similar, check workflow for exact name) has been pushed with the correct tags (e.g., `latest`, branch name, SHA).
    *   **WBS Reference:** Subtask 3.3.4: Verify Docker image appears in GitHub Container Registry.

3.  **(Optional but Recommended) Test Docker Image Locally:**
    *   **Action:** If the image is successfully pushed, attempt to pull it locally (`docker pull <image_url_from_ghcr>`) and run it.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The container starts without immediate errors. A basic health check or API call (if feasible without extensive setup) would be ideal to confirm basic functionality.
    *   **WBS Reference:** Subtask 3.3.5: Test pulling and running image locally (if possible).

4.  **Document Results:**
    *   **Action:** Update the WBS checklist (`docs/plans/github_actions_build_failure/wbs_checklist.md`) for Subtasks 3.3.3, 3.3.4, and 3.3.5 with the outcomes.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Clear documentation of whether Phase 1 (Critical Fix) was successful.
    *   **WBS Reference:** Subtask 3.3.6: Document results and any issues encountered.

## Subsequent Steps (If Phase 1 is Successful)

Refer to the WBS `docs/plans/github_actions_build_failure/wbs_checklist.md` for the full plan. If the above steps confirm Phase 1 success:

*   **Proceed to Phase 3.4: Add Debug Logging:** Implement Solution 2 from `docs/plans/github_actions_build_failure/solutions.md` to add enhanced debug logging and BuildKit optimizations to the workflow.
*   **Continue through Phase 2 (Enhancement) and Phase 3 (Optimization & Monitoring) solutions** as outlined in the WBS and the main `plan.md`.

## Contingency (If Current Build Fails)

1.  **Analyze New Error:** Carefully examine the GitHub Actions logs to understand the new point of failure.
2.  **Update WBS:** Document the new findings in the WBS checklist.
3.  **Systematic Troubleshooting:** Re-apply the troubleshooting protocol:
    *   Formulate hypotheses for the new error.
    *   Test hypotheses (locally if possible, or by observing workflow behavior).
    *   Implement and test fixes.
4.  **Consult Documentation:** Review existing project documentation (`README.md`, `dtma/README.md` if it exists, `Dockerfile` comments, etc.) for any missed details.
5.  **Consider Rollback (if necessary):** If the new error is complex and a quick fix isn't apparent, consider rolling back to the last known "partially working" state (e.g., before TypeScript fixes, if the error is unrelated) to isolate the issue, or use the backups created.
