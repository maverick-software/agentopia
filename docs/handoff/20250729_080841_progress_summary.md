## Key Accomplishments

*   **Web Search Integration**: A comprehensive web search tool was created and integrated into the Agentopia platform. This includes:
    *   Database schema updates to support web search providers and API keys.
    *   A new Supabase Edge Function (`web-search-api`) to handle search, scrape, and summarization tasks.
    *   Integration with the function calling manager to make the tools available to agents.
    *   Frontend components for managing integrations and granting permissions to agents.

*   **UI Fixes**: The UI for the Serper API integration modal was fixed to address layout and display issues. The modal is now responsive and all content is visible.

*   **Testing and Verification**: The web search integration was thoroughly tested to ensure all components are working correctly. The test script confirmed that the database functions, integration setup, tool definitions, and edge function are all operational.
