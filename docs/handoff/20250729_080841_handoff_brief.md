# Handoff Brief - 20250729_080841

## Project Understanding

*   **Project Purpose**: Agentopia is a platform for creating, configuring, and managing AI agents. These agents can collaborate in Workspaces, interact via Discord, and utilize external tools and knowledge bases.
*   **Primary Goals**: The main goal is to provide a comprehensive web UI for managing agents, with a focus on collaborative workspaces and optional integrations like Discord and tool use (MCP).
*   **Technology Stack**: The frontend is built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI. The backend is powered by Supabase, including PostgreSQL, Authentication, Edge Functions, and Realtime services. AI capabilities are driven by OpenAI, with Pinecone for vector storage and GetZep for knowledge graphs.
*   **Architecture Overview**: The system is a monorepo with a React frontend, Supabase backend, and several Node.js microservices for features like Discord integration and tool management.

## Current State Assessment

*   **Development Phase**: The project is in an active development phase, with many core features implemented and ongoing work to expand capabilities and fix bugs.
*   **Recent Progress**: In this session, we successfully:
    *   Completed the web search integration, allowing agents to search the web, scrape pages, and summarize content.
    *   Fixed the UI for the Serper API integration modal, resolving layout and display issues.
    *   Conducted a full test of the web search integration, confirming that all database functions, integration setup, tool definitions, and edge functions are working correctly.
*   **Active Work Streams**: The primary focus of this session was the completion and verification of the web search tool.
*   **Immediate Priorities**: The next steps will involve further enhancements to the platform's stability and feature set, as well as addressing any remaining bugs or user-requested improvements.

## Continuation Requirements

*   **Pending Tasks**: There are no immediate pending tasks from this session, as the web search integration has been completed and verified. The next agent should review the project backlog and active development plans for the next set of priorities.
*   **Known Issues**: The `README.md` file lists several known issues, including the need for a comprehensive logging system, refactoring of large files, and replacing the basic tokenizer with `tiktoken`. These should be addressed in future development cycles.
*   **Dependencies**: The platform has several external dependencies, including Supabase, OpenAI, Pinecone, and DigitalOcean. The status of these services should be monitored.
*   **Success Criteria**: The success of the next session will be measured by the ability to seamlessly continue development, address known issues, and implement new features as per the project roadmap.
