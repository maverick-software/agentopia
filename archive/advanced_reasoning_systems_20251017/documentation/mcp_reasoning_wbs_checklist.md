## Detailed WBS Subchecklists

### 1.0 Analysis & Planning Phase
- [x] 1.1 Review existing reasoning system architecture
  - [x] 1.1.1 Document current ReasoningStage implementation
    **NOTES**: Found in MessageProcessor.ts lines 85-309. ReasoningStage is an inline class that:
    - Uses ReasoningScorer to evaluate message complexity (score vs threshold)
    - Uses ReasoningSelector to pick reasoning style (inductive/deductive/abductive)
    - Creates MemoryIntegratedMarkov instance with memory manager access
    - Executes markov.run() to generate reasoning steps
    - Stores results in metrics.reasoning_steps and message.context.reasoning
    - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Results are NOT passed to TextMessageHandler for LLM integration
  - [x] 1.1.2 Map MemoryIntegratedMarkov functionality
    **NOTES**: Located in memory_integrated_markov.ts. Key features:
    - Extends base Markov with memory retrieval (episodic + semantic)
    - State-specific memory filtering (analyze, hypothesize, test, observe, update, conclude)
    - Memory-aware question building with context injection
    - Enhanced reasoning steps with memory_insights and memories_used fields
    - Confidence adjustment based on memory alignment
  - [x] 1.1.3 Identify integration points with MessageProcessor
    **NOTES**: Integration occurs in MessageProcessor pipeline:
    - ReasoningStage runs BEFORE MainProcessingStage
    - Results stored in message.context.reasoning but NOT used by TextMessageHandler
    - TextMessageHandler (lines 137-675 in handlers.ts) builds LLM prompts without reasoning context
    - **DISCONNECT**: Reasoning results isolated from final response generation
  - [x] 1.1.4 Document current reasoning adapter patterns
    **NOTES**: Found minimal ReasoningAdapter interface in reasoning_adapter.ts:
    - Simple interface with generateSteps method
    - Not actively used in current implementation
    - ReasoningScorer provides complexity evaluation with keyword detection
    - Current system bypasses adapter pattern, uses direct MemoryIntegratedMarkov
- [x] 1.2 Analyze current issues
  - [x] 1.2.1 Document reasoning-to-LLM disconnect
    **CRITICAL ISSUE**: TextMessageHandler (handlers.ts:137-675) never accesses message.context.reasoning
    - Reasoning results stored but never consumed
    - LLM prompts built without reasoning insights
    - No integration between reasoning conclusions and final response
  - [x] 1.2.2 Map unused metrics.reasoning_steps
    **ISSUE**: metrics.reasoning_steps populated but unused downstream
    - Contains detailed step analysis, confidence, memory insights
    - Rich context data (episodic/semantic memory connections) ignored
    - Tool suggestions from reasoning not prioritized
  - [x] 1.2.3 Identify step isolation problems
    **ISSUE**: Each reasoning step operates in isolation
    - No context accumulation between iterations
    - Memory insights not carried forward
    - Confidence not building progressively
  - [x] 1.2.4 Document context accumulation gaps
    **ISSUE**: Context window not leveraged for reasoning continuity
    - Previous reasoning chains not referenced
    - No learning from past reasoning patterns
    - Memory connections not strengthened by reasoning outcomes
