# RLS Policies Update Implementation Research

## üéØ **Task**: Update RLS policies for new tables
**WBS Reference**: 4.2.3  
**Phase**: Database Implementation  
**Date**: January 1, 2025  

## üìã **Implementation Objectives**

1. Review and update existing RLS policies for MCP integration
2. Ensure proper access control for new tables and relationships
3. Add admin-specific policies for monitoring and management
4. Implement cross-table security for complex queries
5. Optimize policy performance and maintainability

## üîç **Current State Analysis**

### **Existing RLS Infrastructure**
From database analysis:
- ‚úÖ RLS enabled on core tables (agents, account_tool_instances)
- ‚úÖ User-based access control implemented
- ‚úÖ Admin role system operational
- ‚úÖ Service role permissions configured

### **New Tables Requiring RLS**
From recent implementations:
- ‚úÖ agent_mcp_connections - user agent ownership
- ‚úÖ agent_mcp_connection_logs - audit trail access
- ‚úÖ mcp_server_status_logs - server monitoring data
- ‚úÖ Related views and archive tables

## üèóÔ∏è **Implementation Plan**

### **1. Enhanced Agent-MCP Connection Policies**

```sql
-- Review and enhance existing policies for agent_mcp_connections
-- These were created in the previous migration but may need optimization

-- Policy: Enhanced user access with performance optimization
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own agent connections" ON agent_mcp_connections;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own agent connections" ON agent_mcp_connections
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        -- Optimized query using EXISTS for better performance
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM agents 
            WHERE id = agent_id 
            AND user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- Policy: Enhanced insert policy with validation
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create connections for their own agents" ON agent_mcp_connections;
CREATE POLICY "Users can create connections for their own agents" ON agent_mcp_connections
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (
        -- Ensure user owns the agent
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM agents 
            WHERE id = agent_id 
            AND user_id = auth.uid()
        )
        AND
        -- Ensure MCP server is available for connections
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM account_tool_instances 
            WHERE id = mcp_server_instance_id 
            AND mcp_server_type IS NOT NULL
            AND status_on_toolbox = 'running'
        )
    );

-- Policy: Enhanced update policy with state validation
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own agent connections" ON agent_mcp_connections;
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own agent connections" ON agent_mcp_connections
    FOR UPDATE
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM agents 
            WHERE id = agent_id 
            AND user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    )
    WITH CHECK (
        -- Prevent users from changing agent_id or server_id
        agent_id = OLD.agent_id
        AND mcp_server_instance_id = OLD.mcp_server_instance_id
        AND
        -- Ensure user still owns the agent
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM agents 
            WHERE id = agent_id 
            AND user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

### **2. Cross-Table Security Policies**

```sql
-- Policy: Admin monitoring access across all MCP-related tables
CREATE POLICY "Admins can monitor all MCP activity" ON agent_mcp_connections
    FOR ALL
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
        )
    )
    WITH CHECK (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
        )
    );

-- Policy: Service role access for system operations
CREATE POLICY "Service role system access" ON agent_mcp_connections
    FOR ALL
    USING (auth.role() = 'service_role')
    WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Enhanced policy for account_tool_instances to support MCP integration
CREATE POLICY "Users can view MCP servers for connection" ON account_tool_instances
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        -- Allow users to see running MCP servers for connection discovery
        mcp_server_type IS NOT NULL 
        AND status_on_toolbox = 'running'
        OR
        -- Allow users to see their own tool instances
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM account_tool_environments ate
            WHERE ate.id = account_tool_environment_id
            AND ate.user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

### **3. Logging and Audit Policies Enhancement**

```sql
-- Enhanced policy for connection logs with better performance
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own connection logs" ON agent_mcp_connection_logs;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own connection logs" ON agent_mcp_connection_logs
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        -- Direct join approach for better performance
        connection_id IN (
            SELECT amc.id 
            FROM agent_mcp_connections amc
            INNER JOIN agents a ON amc.agent_id = a.id
            WHERE a.user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- Enhanced policy for status logs with server access validation
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view relevant status logs" ON mcp_server_status_logs;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view relevant status logs" ON mcp_server_status_logs
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        -- Users can see status logs for servers their agents connect to
        server_id IN (
            SELECT DISTINCT amc.mcp_server_instance_id 
            FROM agent_mcp_connections amc
            INNER JOIN agents a ON amc.agent_id = a.id
            WHERE a.user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND amc.is_active = true
        )
        OR
        -- Users can see status logs for their own deployed servers
        server_id IN (
            SELECT ati.id
            FROM account_tool_instances ati
            INNER JOIN account_tool_environments ate ON ati.account_tool_environment_id = ate.id
            WHERE ate.user_id = auth.uid()
            AND ati.mcp_server_type IS NOT NULL
        )
    );
```

### **4. View-Level Security Policies**

```sql
-- Enable RLS on views that need access control
ALTER VIEW active_agent_mcp_connections SET (security_barrier = true);
ALTER VIEW user_mcp_connection_stats SET (security_barrier = true);
ALTER VIEW recent_connection_activity SET (security_barrier = true);
ALTER VIEW server_health_history SET (security_barrier = true);

-- Create security-aware versions of views
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_agent_mcp_connections_secure AS
SELECT 
    amc.id,
    amc.agent_id,
    a.name AS agent_name,
    a.user_id,
    amc.mcp_server_instance_id,
    ati.instance_name_on_toolbox AS server_name,
    ati.status_on_toolbox AS server_status,
    ati.mcp_server_type AS server_type,
    amc.connection_status,
    amc.connection_config,
    amc.connection_test_result,
    amc.last_used,
    amc.usage_stats,
    amc.created_at,
    amc.updated_at
FROM agent_mcp_connections amc
JOIN agents a ON amc.agent_id = a.id
JOIN account_tool_instances ati ON amc.mcp_server_instance_id = ati.id
WHERE amc.is_active = true
AND (
    -- User can see their own connections
    a.user_id = auth.uid()
    OR
    -- Admins can see all connections
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
        AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
    )
);
```

### **5. Performance Optimization Policies**

```sql
-- Create optimized policies using materialized security context
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_security_context()
RETURNS TABLE(
    user_id UUID,
    is_admin BOOLEAN,
    owned_agent_ids UUID[],
    accessible_server_ids UUID[]
) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    WITH user_context AS (
        SELECT 
            auth.uid() as uid,
            EXISTS (
                SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
                WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
                AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
            ) as is_admin_user
    ),
    user_agents AS (
        SELECT array_agg(id) as agent_ids
        FROM agents 
        WHERE user_id = (SELECT uid FROM user_context)
    ),
    accessible_servers AS (
        SELECT array_agg(DISTINCT server_id) as server_ids
        FROM (
            -- Servers user's agents connect to
            SELECT amc.mcp_server_instance_id as server_id
            FROM agent_mcp_connections amc
            INNER JOIN agents a ON amc.agent_id = a.id
            WHERE a.user_id = (SELECT uid FROM user_context)
            AND amc.is_active = true
            
            UNION
            
            -- Servers user owns
            SELECT ati.id as server_id
            FROM account_tool_instances ati
            INNER JOIN account_tool_environments ate ON ati.account_tool_environment_id = ate.id
            WHERE ate.user_id = (SELECT uid FROM user_context)
            AND ati.mcp_server_type IS NOT NULL
        ) servers
    )
    SELECT 
        uc.uid,
        uc.is_admin_user,
        COALESCE(ua.agent_ids, '{}'),
        COALESCE(as_srv.server_ids, '{}')
    FROM user_context uc
    CROSS JOIN user_agents ua
    CROSS JOIN accessible_servers as_srv;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Optimized policy using security context function
CREATE POLICY "Optimized user access to connections" ON agent_mcp_connections
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        WITH ctx AS (SELECT * FROM get_user_security_context())
        SELECT (
            agent_id = ANY((SELECT owned_agent_ids FROM ctx))
            OR
            (SELECT is_admin FROM ctx)
        )
    );
```

### **6. Admin Dashboard Policies**

```sql
-- Create admin-specific policies for dashboard and monitoring
CREATE POLICY "Admin dashboard access to all agents" ON agents
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
        )
    );

-- Admin access to all tool instances for monitoring
CREATE POLICY "Admin monitoring access to tool instances" ON account_tool_instances

            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
        )
    );

-- Admin modification access for MCP server management
CREATE POLICY "Admin can manage MCP servers" ON account_tool_instances
    FOR UPDATE
    USING (
        mcp_server_type IS NOT NULL
        AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
        )
    )
    WITH CHECK (

            AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
        )
    );
```

### **7. Archive and Cleanup Policies**

```sql
-- Enable RLS on archive tables
ALTER TABLE agent_mcp_connection_logs_archive ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE mcp_server_status_logs_archive ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Archive access policies (admin only for performance)
CREATE POLICY "Admin access to connection log archives" ON agent_mcp_connection_logs_archive
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
        )
    );

CREATE POLICY "Admin access to status log archives" ON mcp_server_status_logs_archive
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
        )
    );

-- Service role access for cleanup operations
CREATE POLICY "Service role archive management" ON agent_mcp_connection_logs_archive

    WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');

CREATE POLICY "Service role archive management" ON mcp_server_status_logs_archive
    FOR ALL
    USING (auth.role() = 'service_role')
    WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

### **8. Policy Testing and Validation**

```sql
-- Function to test RLS policies
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_rls_policies()
RETURNS TABLE(
    test_name TEXT,
    passed BOOLEAN,
    details TEXT
) AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Test 1: User can only see their own connections
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT 
        'User connection isolation'::TEXT,
        NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM agent_mcp_connections amc
            JOIN agents a ON amc.agent_id = a.id
            WHERE a.user_id != auth.uid()
        ),
        'Users should not see connections for other users agents'::TEXT;
    
    -- Test 2: User can see available MCP servers
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT 
        'MCP server visibility'::TEXT,
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM account_tool_instances
            WHERE mcp_server_type IS NOT NULL
            AND status_on_toolbox = 'running'
        ),
        'Users should see available MCP servers'::TEXT;
    
    -- Test 3: User can access their connection logs
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT 
        'Connection log access'::TEXT,
        NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM agent_mcp_connection_logs acl
            WHERE connection_id NOT IN (
                SELECT id FROM agent_mcp_connections amc
                JOIN agents a ON amc.agent_id = a.id
                WHERE a.user_id = auth.uid()
            )
        ),
        'Users should only see logs for their connections'::TEXT;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cautionary Notes**

1. **Policy Performance**: Complex policies can impact query performance
2. **Policy Conflicts**: Ensure policies don't conflict with each other
3. **Admin Access**: Verify admin users have appropriate access
4. **Service Role**: Ensure service role can perform system operations
5. **Cross-Table Dependencies**: Test policies across related tables

## üîÑ **Future Intent**

1. **Immediate**: Deploy enhanced policies with performance optimization
2. **Phase 2**: Add role-based access control for different user types
3. **Phase 3**: Implement dynamic policies based on subscription levels
4. **Long-term**: Add AI-driven security policy recommendations

## üîó **Dependencies**

- **Prerequisite**: All new tables deployed with basic RLS
- **Required**: user_roles table operational
- **Needed**: Performance testing environment
- **Depends on**: Admin role assignment system

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

1. **Policy Isolation**: Test user data isolation
2. **Admin Access**: Verify admin can access all data
3. **Performance Impact**: Measure query performance with policies
4. **Cross-Table Security**: Test complex queries across tables
5. **Service Operations**: Verify system functions work correctly
