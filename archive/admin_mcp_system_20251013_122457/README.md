# Admin MCP System Archive

**Archive Date:** October 13, 2025 12:24 PM
**Reason:** Deprecated admin MCP management system cleanup

## Files Archived

1. **adminMCPService.ts** - Admin MCP service with operation logging
2. **AdminMCPMarketplaceManagement.tsx** - Admin marketplace management UI page
3. **OneClickMCPDeployment.tsx** - One-click MCP deployment component

## Database Tables Removed

- `admin_operation_logs` - Admin operation audit trail table

## Related Routes Removed

- `/admin/marketplace` - Admin MCP marketplace management route

## Context

This system was part of the legacy MCP server management infrastructure where admins could deploy and manage MCP servers. The system has been deprecated in favor of the new architecture.

## Migration Path

The current MCP system uses:
- User-managed MCP connections via agent configuration
- Standard MCP protocol implementation
- No admin-level deployment interface

## Restoration

If needed, these files can be restored from this archive, but the corresponding database tables and routes would need to be recreated.
