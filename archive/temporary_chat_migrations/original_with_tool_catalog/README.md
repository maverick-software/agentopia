# Archived Temporary Chat Migrations - Original with Tool Catalog

## Archive Date
September 18, 2025

## Reason for Archive
The original migration files included tool_catalog table insertions, but the current database schema doesn't have the tool_catalog table available or it has a different structure than expected. 

## What Was Archived
- Original migration files that included comprehensive tool catalog entries
- These migrations were designed to integrate with the Universal Tool Executor system
- Full MCP tool definitions for all temporary chat functionality

## Current Status
- Simplified migrations created that work with current database schema
- Tool catalog integration deferred until table structure is confirmed
- Service provider registration working correctly

## Future Integration
These archived files can be used as reference when:
1. The tool_catalog table structure is confirmed
2. MCP tool integration is ready to be implemented
3. Universal Tool Executor integration is needed

## Files That Would Have Been Archived
- 20250918000001_add_temporary_chat_service_provider.sql (original version with tool_catalog)
- Tool definitions for:
  - create_temporary_chat_link
  - list_temporary_chat_links
  - update_temporary_chat_link
  - delete_temporary_chat_link
  - get_temporary_chat_analytics
  - manage_temporary_chat_session

## Migration Strategy
Current approach:
1. âœ… Service provider registration (simplified)
2. âœ… Core table creation
3. âœ… Indexes and RLS policies
4. âœ… Functions and cleanup
5. ðŸ”„ Tool catalog integration (deferred)
6. ðŸ”„ MCP tool registration (deferred)
