# Workflow & Project Management Migration Package

## Overview
This package contains a complete clone of the workflow and project management capabilities from the CatalystHQ platform, organized for migration to another platform using the same technology stack (React, TypeScript, Supabase, Node.js).

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand with custom state management library
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS)
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Integration Features
- **Workflow-to-Project**: Convert completed workflows into projects
- **Hybrid Templates**: Combine template structure with workflow data
- **State Synchronization**: Keep workflow and project states in sync
- **Compatibility Layer**: Support for legacy template and flow systems

## Key Components

### Services (Core Business Logic)
1. **unifiedWorkflowService.ts** - Main workflow engine with template and instance management
2. **projectService.ts** - Project management with CRUD operations and team management
3. **projectFlowService.ts** - Integration between workflows and projects
4. **projectTemplateService.ts** - Template management and duplication

### State Management
- Complete Zustand-based state management system
- Workflow stores for templates, instances, and builder state

## File Size Compliance

**Note**: Several files exceed the 500-line limit and require refactoring:

### Files Requiring Refactoring
- `unifiedWorkflowService.ts` (1565 lines) → Split into modules
- `projectService.ts` (531 lines) → Break into smaller services
- Large component files → Decompose into smaller components

### Refactoring Strategy
1. **Service Modules**: Split large services into domain-specific modules
2. **Component Decomposition**: Break large components into smaller, focused components
3. **Hook Extraction**: Extract complex logic into custom hooks
4. **Utility Functions**: Move shared logic to utility modules

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Database setup and migrations
2. Core services implementation
3. State management system
4. Basic type definitions

### Phase 2: Admin Interfaces (Week 2)
1. Template management pages
2. Flow builder interface
3. Project administration
4. User management

### Phase 3: User Interfaces (Week 3)
1. Workflow execution pages
2. Project management interfaces
3. Client-facing components
4. Integration testing

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 4)
1. Workflow-project integration
2. End-to-end testing
3. Performance optimization
4. Documentation completion

## Migration Considerations
