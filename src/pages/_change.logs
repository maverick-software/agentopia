## 2025-04-09 - Refactor Fetch Logic & Limit Attempts
- Applied strict fetch attempt limits (max 5) using `useRef` to `Agents.tsx`, `Datastores.tsx`, `AgentEdit.tsx`, `AgentChat.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`.
- Refactored `useEffect` hooks in these components to define fetch logic internally, simplifying dependencies.
- Removed `useCallback` wrapper around fetch functions.
- Updated retry button logic to reset state appropriately.
- *Goal: Prevent excessive API requests caused by fetch loops.*
