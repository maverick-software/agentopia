-- Purpose: Remove integration_capabilities records that reference non-existent service_providers

-- First, let's see what we're dealing with
DO $$

-- Remove orphaned integration_capabilities records
DELETE FROM integration_capabilities

-- Now we can safely add the constraint

-- Log the cleanup
