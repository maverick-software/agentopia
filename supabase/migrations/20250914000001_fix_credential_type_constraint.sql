-- Migration: Fix credential type consistency constraint
-- Purpose: Update constraint to work with renamed user_integration_credentials table
-- Issue: Constraint was created on user_oauth_connections but table was renamed
-- File: 20250914000001_fix_credential_type_constraint.sql

-- Drop the old constraint if it exists on the renamed table
