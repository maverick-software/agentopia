// Re-exporting core types from dots-wrapper for convenience if needed elsewhere,
// or define specific request/response types for our service methods.
// Example: Re-exporting the Droplet type from dots-wrapper
// The actual path might vary based on dots-wrapper structure, e.g., dots-wrapper/dist/modules/droplet
// For now, let's assume it's directly accessible or we define our own simplified versions.
 // Add other service-specific types as the module grows (e.g., for firewalls, volumes)
