Create this new integration: [integration]

This integration is a [channel][tool]

Consider our MCP tool use system. Make sure this is made available to our agents via the MCP tool_use 

Consider the agent edit page tools and channels modals, ensuring they are coded to automatically show up.

Consider the comprehensive message adapters and chat system

Consider the integrations page and the credential page. Ensure these encoded properly.

Consider the database schema. Perform a schema dump into a sql file, and review ALL tables to ensure you understand the table schemas.

Under the @plan_and_execute.mdc protocol, follow the planning, wbs_checklist and research rules to make this happen.

Research the web to ensure you have the proper API information from the website itself.

Research the forums to find out what is currently working for AI MCP tool agents for this integration.
