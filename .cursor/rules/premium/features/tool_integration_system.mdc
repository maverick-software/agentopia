Create this new integration: [integration]

This integration is a [channel][tool]

Here are the rules:

1. Consider our MCP tool use system. Investigate the existing documentation and codebae. Make sure this integration is made available to our agents via the MCP tool use protocol.

2. Consider the agent edit page tools and channels modals, ensuring they are coded to automatically show up. (Creat the UI and wire them up properly)

Consider the comprehensive message adapters and chat system.

a. Ensure you create the integration to work with our MCP system and that it should work inside our adapter system.

Consider the integrations page and the credential page. Ensure these encoded properly.

Consider the database schema. Perform a schema dump into a sql file, and review ALL tables to ensure you understand the table schemas.

Consider persistence, ensuring that all states are saved and appropriately retrieved from the database for these tools, channels and credentials.

Under the @plan_and_execute.mdc protocol, follow the planning, wbs_checklist and research rules to make this happen.

Research the web to ensure you have the proper API information from the website itself.

Research the forums to find out what is currently working for AI MCP tool agents for this integration.
