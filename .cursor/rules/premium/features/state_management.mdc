# Unified State Management Library Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive, centrally managed but modular architecture that handles state management, caching, and debugging in a library-style form for the CatalystHQ application. The solution will be designed to easily apply or remove state management components, implement intelligent caching mechanisms, and provide an internal debugging system with comprehensive logging.

## Problem Statement

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the current workflow page builder, we've identified several critical issues:

1. **Excessive Re-rendering**: Components re-render unnecessarily when tabbing away or during state changes
2. **Poor State Management Architecture**: Lack of centralized, modular state management
3. **No Centralized Caching**: Each hook manages its own cache leading to inconsistencies
4. **Limited Debugging Capabilities**: No systematic logging or debugging infrastructure
5. **Performance Issues**: Database timeouts, infinite loops, and memory leaks
6. **Tight Coupling**: State logic tightly coupled with UI components

## Solution Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Modular Design**: Each state management component can be independently added or removed
2. **Library-Style Implementation**: Reusable across different parts of the application
3. **Performance First**: Minimize re-renders and optimize memory usage
4. **Developer Experience**: Rich debugging tools and clear APIs
5. **Scalability**: Architecture that grows with the application

### Technology Stack Research

Based on web research and current trends in 2024-2025:

- **Primary State Management**: Zustand (chosen for its simplicity, performance, and modular nature)
- **Caching Layer**: Custom implementation with TTL, LRU eviction, and persistence
- **Debugging System**: Custom logging infrastructure with structured logging
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance metrics and monitoring
- **Immutability**: Immer integration for safe state mutations

## Cache Size Management & Restrictions

### Overview

The unified state management system implements strict cache size management to prevent memory overflow, ensure optimal performance, and maintain system stability. These restrictions are **MANDATORY** and must be implemented in all cache-related functionality.

### Critical Implementation Requirements

#### Data Type Specific Limits (MANDATORY)

**Memory Limits per Data Type:**
```typescript
const CACHE_SIZE_LIMITS = {
  'template': 10 * 1024 * 1024,        // 10MB - templates with hierarchies
  'permissions': 2 * 1024 * 1024,      // 2MB - permission sets
  'instance': 5 * 1024 * 1024,         // 5MB - workflow instances
  'ui:state': 1 * 1024 * 1024,         // 1MB - UI state data
  'user:prefs': 512 * 1024,            // 512KB - user preferences
  'metadata': 3 * 1024 * 1024,         // 3MB - metadata objects
  'hierarchy': 8 * 1024 * 1024,        // 8MB - complex hierarchies
  'default': 2 * 1024 * 1024           // 2MB - unspecified types
};
```

**Entry Count Limits per Data Type:**
```typescript
const CACHE_ENTRY_LIMITS = {
  'template': 200,        // 200 templates maximum
  'permissions': 100,     // 100 permission sets
  'instance': 500,        // 500 workflow instances
  'ui:state': 50,         // 50 UI state entries
  'user:prefs': 100,      // 100 user preference sets
  'metadata': 300,        // 300 metadata entries
  'hierarchy': 150,       // 150 hierarchies
  'default': 100          // 100 default entries
};
```

#### Global System Limits (MANDATORY)

**Absolute Maximum Limits:**
- **Total Memory Limit**: 50MB across all caches
- **Warning Threshold**: 40MB (80% of total limit)
- **Critical Threshold**: 45MB (90% of total limit)
- **Maximum Total Entries**: 2,000 entries across all caches
- **Cleanup Batch Size**: 50 entries per cleanup operation

**Monitoring Intervals:**
- **Memory Check Interval**: 30 seconds (continuous monitoring)
- **Emergency Cleanup Trigger**: Immediate when critical threshold reached
- **Preventive Cleanup Trigger**: When warning threshold reached

### Required Implementation Functions

#### Size Validation Functions (MUST IMPLEMENT)

```typescript
// MANDATORY: Check cache size limits before operations
export const getCacheMaxSize = (dataType: string): number => {
  // Implementation required in cache-integration.ts
};

export const getCacheMaxEntries = (dataType: string): number => {
  // Implementation required in cache-integration.ts
};

// MANDATORY: Validate cache operations against limits
export const setCachedWithSizeValidation = <T>(
  key: string,
  data: T,
  options?: CacheOptions
): boolean => {
  // Implementation required - returns false if limits exceeded
};
```

#### Monitoring Functions (MUST IMPLEMENT)

```typescript
// MANDATORY: Real-time size limit monitoring
export const checkCacheSizeLimits = (): {
  status: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'critical';
  totalMemory: number;
  totalEntries: number;
  recommendations: string[];
} => {
  // Implementation required in cache-integration.ts
};

// MANDATORY: Continuous monitoring setup
export const setupCacheSizeMonitoring = (): (() => void) => {
  // Implementation required - returns cleanup function
};
```

#### Cleanup Functions (MUST IMPLEMENT)

```typescript
// MANDATORY: Intelligent cache cleanup
export const performIntelligentCleanup = (targetReduction: number): {
  cleanedEntries: number;
  memoryFreed: number;
  actions: string[];
} => {
  // Implementation required - multi-stage cleanup process
};
```

### Cleanup Strategy Implementation (MANDATORY)

#### Three-Stage Cleanup Process

**Stage 1: Expired Entry Removal**
- **Priority**: Highest
- **Action**: Remove all expired cache entries first
- **Logic**: Check TTL expiration for all entries
- **Performance**: Most efficient memory recovery

**Stage 2: Low-Priority Entry Removal**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Action**: Remove entries marked as 'low' priority
- **Trigger**: When Stage 1 insufficient for memory requirements
- **Batch Size**: Maximum 50 entries per operation

**Stage 3: LRU (Least Recently Used) Removal**
- **Priority**: Lowest (Emergency)
- **Action**: Remove least recently accessed entries
- **Trigger**: When critical memory threshold reached
- **Logic**: Sort by last access time, remove oldest first

#### Cleanup Triggering Conditions

**Automatic Cleanup Triggers:**
- Memory usage ≥ 40MB (Warning): Perform preventive cleanup (15% reduction)
- Memory usage ≥ 45MB (Critical): Perform emergency cleanup (30% reduction)
- Entry count ≥ 1,800: Perform entry count cleanup
- Individual data type ≥ 90% of limit: Perform type-specific cleanup

### Required Admin Interface Integration

#### Cache Management Controls (MANDATORY)

**Admin Panel Must Include:**
- Real-time memory usage display with visual indicators
- Cache size status: healthy/warning/critical
- Manual cleanup triggers for each data type
- Emergency cleanup button for critical situations
- Memory usage breakdown by data type
- Entry count monitoring with limits display

**Visual Requirements:**
- Color-coded status indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Progress bars for memory usage vs. limits
- Size formatting in human-readable units (MB, KB, GB)
- Real-time updates during cleanup operations

### Error Handling Requirements (MANDATORY)

#### Cache Operation Failures

**Size Limit Exceeded:**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Handle cache set failures due to size limits
if (!setCachedWithSizeValidation(key, data, options)) {
  // Log the failure
  logger.warn('Cache set rejected - size limit exceeded', {
    key,
    dataType: options?.dataType,
    currentSize: getCurrentCacheSize(),
    attemptedSize: getDataSize(data)
  });
  
  // Attempt automatic cleanup and retry
  const cleanup = performIntelligentCleanup(0.2);
  if (cleanup.memoryFreed >= getDataSize(data)) {
    return setCachedWithSizeValidation(key, data, { ...options, force: true });
  }
  
  // Final failure - return false
  return false;
}
```

#### Emergency Procedures

**Critical Memory Usage:**
- **Immediate Action**: Stop all new cache operations
- **Emergency Cleanup**: Remove 30% of cache content
- **System Alert**: Log critical memory situation
- **User Notification**: Display admin warning if applicable
- **Recovery**: Resume normal operations after cleanup

### Performance Impact Guidelines

#### Memory Monitoring Overhead

**Acceptable Performance Impact:**
- Memory checks: <5ms execution time
- Size calculations: <2ms per operation
- Cleanup operations: <50ms for batch operations
- Monitoring intervals: Must not impact user experience

**Optimization Requirements:**
- Use efficient size calculation methods
- Implement lazy loading for large cache inspections
- Batch multiple operations for performance
- Cache size calculations where possible

### Developer Guidelines

#### Cache Operations Best Practices

**Always Use Size Validation:**
```typescript
// CORRECT: Use size validation
const success = setCachedWithSizeValidation(key, data, { dataType: 'template' });
if (!success) {
  // Handle failure appropriately
  handleCacheFailure(key, data);
}

// INCORRECT: Direct cache operations without validation
setCached(key, data); // May cause memory overflow
```

**Implement Proper Error Handling:**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Handle cache operation failures
try {
  const cached = await getCached(key, fallbackFn, { dataType: 'instance' });
  return cached;
} catch (error) {
  // Log cache failure but continue operation
  logger.warn('Cache operation failed', { key, error });
  return fallbackFn(); // Always provide fallback
}
```

#### Data Type Classification

**Correctly Classify Cache Data:**
- Use specific data types ('template', 'instance', 'permissions')
- Avoid 'default' type except for truly unclassified data
- Consider data size and frequency when choosing types
- Document data type rationale in code comments

#### Memory-Conscious Development

**Optimize Data Before Caching:**
- Serialize large objects efficiently
- Remove unnecessary properties before caching
- Use compression for large text data
- Implement data transformation for cache storage

### Compliance and Auditing

#### Mandatory Compliance Checks

**Regular Audits Must Verify:**
- All cache operations use size validation
- Monitoring systems are functioning correctly
- Cleanup procedures execute within time limits
- Admin interfaces display accurate information
- Error handling follows established patterns

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Document all custom data types and their limits
- Maintain change log for limit modifications
- Record rationale for cache size decisions
- Update this document when limits change
