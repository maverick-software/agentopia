# AI-Specific Considerations and Guidelines

## Overview
This document covers specific requirements and best practices for AI-powered apps submitting to the App Store, including content filtering, age ratings, and technical considerations.

## Content Filtering for AI Outputs

### Mandatory Filtering Requirements
- If your app generates chat responses, images, or videos via AI, implement robust content filtering
- Apple will check that AI-generated content is appropriate for the app's age rating
- If you do not have sufficient filtering, Apple may require you to rate the app 17+
- For a broader audience, use filters to block or refuse disallowed content:
  - Hate speech
  - Violence
  - Sexual content
  - Other prohibited material

### Implementation Best Practices
- Implement multiple layers of content filtering
- Use both automated and manual review systems
- Log and analyze filtered content to improve systems
- Have fallback responses for blocked content
- Test filtering extensively with edge cases

## Age Rating and AI Content

### Default Recommendation: 17+ Rating
- By default, consider setting a 17+ age rating if there's any doubt about controlling the AI's output
- Apple has, in practice, asked developers to raise ratings to 17+ for apps using generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT integration)
- This is due to the risk of inappropriate content generation

### Lower Age Rating Requirements
- You can keep a lower age rating only if you are confident your content filters are effective
- Must prevent ALL mature or offensive material
- Requires extensive testing and documentation of filtering capabilities
- Consider the unpredictable nature of AI outputs

## User Input Management

### Treating User Prompts as UGC
- Treat user prompts to the AI as you would any user-generated content
- Prevent or handle abusive inputs
- If a user asks the AI to produce disallowed content, your app should refuse or filter that request
- The combination of user input and AI output must not create a loophole to produce guideline-violating material

### Input Validation
- Implement input sanitization and validation
- Block known problematic prompt patterns
- Monitor and log concerning user inputs
- Have policies for handling repeat offenders

## Moderation System Requirements

### AI-Generated Media Moderation
- Have a moderation system in place (automated or manual review)
- Required for any AI-generated images/videos
- Must catch content like:
  - Nudity
  - Graphic violence
  - Illegal content
- Apps that allow sharing of AI-generated media especially need reporting and take-down mechanisms

### Reporting and Take-Down
- Implement user reporting mechanisms
- Provide easy ways to report inappropriate AI outputs
- Have clear take-down procedures
- Log problematic outputs for system improvement
- Consider banning users who repeatedly attempt to generate prohibited content

## Quality and Accuracy Considerations

### Disclaimers and Transparency
- Consider including disclaimers that AI content might be imperfect
- While not strictly an Apple requirement, transparency helps user understanding
- Example: "This answer is AI-generated and may be incorrect"
- Can potentially satisfy App Review if the AI could produce confusing or erroneous content
- Avoid guaranteeing accuracy in marketing

### Managing User Expectations
- Be clear about AI limitations
- Don't oversell AI capabilities
- Provide context for AI-generated content
- Allow users to understand when content is AI-generated

## Regulated Advice Restrictions

### Professional Advice Limitations
- Ensure your AI does not give medical, legal, or financial advice that could be harmful
- Must not be presented as professional counsel
- Apple may reject apps that offer such guidance without proper disclaimers or credentials

### Required Disclaimers
- If your productivity app's AI touches regulated areas (even inadvertently via user prompts):
  - Include warnings (e.g., "For informational purposes only")
  - Avoid any claim of professional certification
  - Make clear the AI is not a substitute for professional advice

## Technical Performance Requirements

### Resource Usage and Responsiveness
- Since AI processing is mostly on the backend, ensure the app remains responsive
- Long waits for AI responses should be communicated via:
  - Loading spinners
  - Progress messages
  - Estimated time remaining
- Apple will test the app â€“ consistent timeouts or broken feel due to slow AI servers could cause rejection

### Network Error Handling
- Optimize your backend for reliability
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Show clear error messages if the AI service is unreachable
- Provide offline functionality where possible
- Don't let the app appear broken due to server issues

## Privacy of AI Data

### Data Processing Transparency
- If user-provided data (text prompts, images, etc.) is sent to your servers or an AI API for processing, inform the user
- Clarify in your privacy policy and possibly in-app
- Example: "User input may be processed on our servers to generate responses"
- Ensure any sensitive data isn't inadvertently logged or stored without consent

### Data Handling Best Practices
- Minimize data collection and retention
- Use encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Have clear data deletion policies
- Allow users to delete their AI interaction history
- Be transparent about data sharing with third-party AI services

## Third-Party AI Services

### API Compliance
- If using third-party AI APIs (OpenAI, etc.), ensure compliance with both their terms and Apple's
- Do not expose API keys or credentials in the app
- Apple will reject the app if it finds hardcoded secrets
- Ensure the app's use of an API doesn't violate that API's usage policies

### Service Reliability
- Have fallback plans for API outages
- Monitor third-party service status
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Consider rate limiting and quota management
