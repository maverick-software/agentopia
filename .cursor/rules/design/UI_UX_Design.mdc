Design Instruction Set for Cursor Agent



1) Apply a Style Type 

`Note for user: choose a style from the list: Minimalist, Neumorphic, Flat Design, Material Design, Glassmorphism, Skeuomorphic, Brutalist, Dark Mode, Light Mode `
  
Apply this style type and principles to all UI/UX design: **Flat Design (Dark Mode Focus)** 

2) Use the following libraries: **Shadcn UI** and **Tailwind CSS**. Use **Lucide React** for icons.


2) Colors should match the defined palette (update with current design if blank): 

Primary Color: **Indigo (e.g., `bg-indigo-500`, `text-indigo-400`)**  
Secondary Color: **Gray (e.g., `bg-gray-700`, `text-gray-400`)**  
Accent Colors: **(Varies, potentially other blues/purples)**  
Background Color: **Dark Gray (e.g., `bg-gray-900` base, `bg-gray-800` cards)**  
Text Color: **White/Light Gray (e.g., `text-white`, `text-gray-300`, `text-gray-400`)**  
Success/Error Colors: **Green (`text-green-500`) / Red (`text-red-500`)**  
Ensure contrast ratios meet AA or AAA accessibility standards.  

3) Follow Proper Content Hierarchy  

a) Organize the page into sections, rows, columns and objects.
- Use typographic structure to organize information:  
- H1: Page title, one per page (e.g., `text-2xl font-bold`)  
- H2: Section headings (e.g., `text-xl font-semibold`)  
- H3: Subsections/Card Titles (e.g., `text-lg font-semibold`)  
- Body Text: Minimum 16px font with proper line spacing (e.g., `text-base`, `text-sm` for secondary)  
- Captions/Notes: For footnotes or supporting info (e.g., `text-xs`, `text-gray-500`)  
- Use a standard sans-serif font (Tailwind default).

b) Break interfaces into reusable design components:  
- Buttons  
- Cards  
- Modals  
- Forms  
- Navigation bars  
- Footers  

Each component should follow the atomic design model: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages t for headings and a separate one for body content 

4) Design Buttons Properly  
 
- Clearly styled for primary, secondary, and tertiary use  
- Sized for accessibility (at least 44px height)  
- Labeled with concise action words (e.g., Start Now, Download, Learn More)  
- Responsive to hover, focus, and click events  
- Visibly different from surrounding text  

5) Apply Spacing and Layout Best Practices  
Use a consistent spacing scale (**Tailwind's default scale (multiples of 4px): `p-1`, `p-2`, `p-4`, `m-2`, `m-4`, `m-6`, `gap-4`, `space-x-3`, etc.**)  
Margins separate sections  
Padding creates internal space  
Use a standard grid system (**Tailwind's responsive grid (`grid`, `grid-cols-*`, `md:grid-cols-*`)**)  
Maintain visual breathing room with sufficient whitespace  
Align components and maintain consistent spacing between them (**Use Flexbox/Grid utilities**)  

6) Ensure Responsiveness  
Design should adjust to various screen widths:  
Mobile: 375px  
Tablet: 768px  
Desktop: 1440px and 1920px  
Ultra-wide: 2560px or higher  
Ensure all content remains legible and components reflow properly 

7) Follow Core UI/UX Design Principles  

a) Ensure all designs follow foundational UI/UX laws and principles:  
- Consistency and Standards: Use familiar patterns and interface elements.  
- Visual Hierarchy: Use size, contrast, and spacing to guide attention.  
- Feedback Principle: Every user action should have a clear response.  
- Aesthetic-Usability Effect: Visually appealing interfaces are easier to use.  
- Fitts's Law: Make clickable elements large and easy to reach.  
- Hick's Law: Simplify user choices to speed up decisions.  
- Accessibility: Follow WCAG guidelines for contrast, navigation, and readability.  
- Responsiveness: Designs should work across mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
b) **Workspace Layout Principle:** Emulate Discord's three-column layout where applicable:
    - **Left Column:** Navigation / Channel List / Server List
    - **Center Column:** Main Content / Chat Area
    - **Right Column:** Contextual Information / Member List / Metadata

8) Use Component-Based Structure  

b) Also reference design systems such as:  
- Atomic Design  
- Google Material Design  
- Apple Human Interface Guidelines  
- Microsoft Fluent UI   

9) Include Motion and Microinteraction Guidelines  

If using animation:  
- Use subtle transitions (e.g., **Tailwind `transition-colors duration-200` for hover effects**)  
- Keep transitions under 300ms  
- Use natural easing (ease-in-out)  
- Avoid animating critical content  
- Only use motion to enhance usability, not to distract
