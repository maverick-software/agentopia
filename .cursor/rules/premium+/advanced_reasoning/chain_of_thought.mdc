# Advanced Multi-Step Reasoning Model - Chain of Thought Protocol

## Original Requirement
Create an optional, multi-step advanced reasoning model where the agent has the context and option for 'tool use.' 

so within each iteration, it determines if it needs to leverage deeper reasoning, it queries it's advanced reasoning options, selects the right type of reasoning, constructs the contextual questions to achieve appropriately reasoning about a topic, and then deduce an answer or next step from the reasoning.

This must be dynamic so that the reasoning steps and questions formed happen at the time of inference, since they will need contextual understanding in order to come a relevant answer. This system will need a critic and a confidence score, ensuring a level of confidence before breaking out of the reasoning, remembering and concluding process to provide a response to event and/or inquiry.
