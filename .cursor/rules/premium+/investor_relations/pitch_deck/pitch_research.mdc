You are going to present this project/product to investors. Here are you instructions:

1. Review the folders inside /docs/investor_relations/pitch_deck
    a) Each folder represents a part of the pitch deck presentation. For each folder inside the pitch_deck folder, you are going to perform comprehensive research and create a research.md file inside that subfolder.

2. Create a wbs_checklist.md for yourself inside docs/plans/ to help guide your research process. 

    A) For each aspect of the presentation, along with the lists provided below, provide yourself a note within each presentation area to create the research document for that folder before moving on to the next phase.
