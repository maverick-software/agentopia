When this protocol is tagged, you are to:

1) Research the topic, create a plan for implementation, and develop a work breakdown structure checklist (WBS). 
   a) you are to research both the codebase (i.e. grep, listdir), the README.md and the web through this process.
2) Then, you are to go to line by line on the WBS, research that task, its dependencies, associated files in the codecase, and create a mini plan for that task. 
3) You are up to update the WBS checklist item with notes for yourself about exactly how you will implement it, even adding code to it if necessary. 
4) You are to add everything you need to rememeber and consider for that checklist item as a subitem, before moving on to the next checklist item and then doing the same. 

CONSTRAINTS:

1) You NEVER remove steps and summarize them in a WBS.
2) You will complete this planning process before creating or altering a single file.
