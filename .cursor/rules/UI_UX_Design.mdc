Design Instruction Set for Cursor Agent



1) Apply a Style Type 

`Note for user: choose a style from the list: Minimalist, Neumorphic, Flat Design, Material Design, Glassmorphism, Skeuomorphic, Brutalist, Dark Mode, Light Mode `
  
Apply this style type and principles to all UI/UX design: ______________________  


2) Colors should match the defined palette (update with current design if blank): 

Primary Color: ______  
Secondary Color: ______  
Accent Colors: ______  
Background Color: ______  
Text Color: ______  
Success/Error Colors: ______ / ______  
Ensure contrast ratios meet AA or AAA accessibility standards.  

3) Follow Proper Content Hierarchy  

a) Organize the page into sections, rows, columns and objects.
- Use typographic structure to organize information:  
- H1: Page title, one per page  
- H2: Section headings  
- H3: Subsections  
- Body Text: Minimum 16px font with proper line spacing  
- Captions/Notes: For footnotes or supporting info  
- Use one fon8. Use Component-Based Structure  

b) Break interfaces into reusable design components:  
- Buttons  
- Cards  
- Modals  
- Forms  
- Navigation bars  
- Footers  

Each component should follow the atomic design model: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages t for headings and a separate one for body content 

4) Design Buttons Properly  
 
- Clearly styled for primary, secondary, and tertiary use  
- Sized for accessibility (at least 44px height)  
- Labeled with concise action words (e.g., Start Now, Download, Learn More)  
- Responsive to hover, focus, and click events  
- Visibly different from surrounding text  

5) Apply Spacing and Layout Best Practices  
Use a consistent spacing scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px)  
Margins separate sections  
Padding creates internal space  
Use a standard grid system (e.g., 12-column for desktop, 4/8-column for mobile)  
Maintain visual breathing room with sufficient whitespace  
Align components and maintain consistent spacing between them  

6) Ensure Responsiveness  
Design should adjust to various screen widths:  
Mobile: 375px  
Tablet: 768px  
Desktop: 1440px and 1920px  
Ultra-wide: 2560px or higher  
Ensure all content remains legible and components reflow properly 

7) Follow Core UI/UX Design Principles  

a) Ensure all designs follow foundational UI/UX laws and principles:  
- Consistency and Standards: Use familiar patterns and interface elements.  
- Visual Hierarchy: Use size, contrast, and spacing to guide attention.  
- Feedback Principle: Every user action should have a clear response.  
- Aesthetic-Usability Effect: Visually appealing interfaces are easier to use.  
- Fitts’s Law: Make clickable elements large and easy to reach.  
- Hick’s Law: Simplify user choices to speed up decisions.  
- Accessibility: Follow WCAG guidelines for contrast, navigation, and readability.  
- Responsiveness: Designs should work across mobile, tablet, and desktop.  

8) Consider Applying Recognized UX Workflows and Frameworks  

a) Use proven frameworks to inform design flow and structure:  
- User-Centered Design  
- Design Thinking  
- Lean UX  
- Double Diamond Process  
- Jobs-to-be-Done  

b) Also reference design systems such as:  
- Atomic Design  
- Google Material Design  
- Apple Human Interface Guidelines  
- Microsoft Fluent UI   

9) Include Motion and Microinteraction Guidelines  

If using animation:  
- Keep transitions under 300ms  
- Use natural easing (ease-in-out)  
- Avoid animating critical content  
- Only use motion to enhance usability, not to distract
