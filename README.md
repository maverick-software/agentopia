# Gofr Agents - Agent Creation & Collaboration Platform

Gofr Agents allows users to create, configure, and manage AI agents via a web UI. These agents can collaborate within Workspaces, interact with Discord, leverage external tools (MCP), and access knowledge bases (RAG).

### 🛠️ For Tool Developers

Gofr Agents uses a sophisticated MCP (Model Context Protocol) infrastructure that makes it easy to add new tools and integrations:

- **Universal Tool Execution**: Single pathway for all tool types with automatic routing
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Tools are automatically discovered and registered based on permissions  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Add new tools without modifying core chat functionality
- **Complete Documentation**: Step-by-step guides for tool development and deployment

**[📖 Read the Tool Infrastructure Guide](README/tool-infrastructure.md)** for complete information on developing, registering, and deploying MCP tools.
